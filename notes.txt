Notes to this point 

Prompt 6

Functional code--very cool.
Weird way of packaging it so that it tries to reproduce the environment every time
No real understanding of the goal.  It is now grabbing stats with no context. No real use in that.

Prompt 7

Very cool: gpt has a side bar for previous contexts, so I was able to jump right into this.  Although when I initially asked it if it maintained context, it said no.  Back in business!

First error--import os was missing
Output now is in a .json file
I validated it.  It is valid json

'Final Prompt' - I will likely add more

Output is now empty.  I am experimenting with using gpt to help me diagnose the problem.  But I must resort to ye olde fashiony debuggening, as gpt isn't finding what turns out to be an obvious bug quickly.  Debugging code you did not write is never easy.  

I should note that gpt added comments, but they are of the worst sort.  They tell you what the name of each function is, but not what the function does (if not obvious) or how, or anything like that...


I identified the general problem and gpt proposed a new clean_text() funtion.  Unfortunately this does not run--it has a bug.

At this point I ran out of tokens for the day
