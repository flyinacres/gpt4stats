CONTEXT: Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a widely used nursing practice rooted in 
mysticism but alleged to have a scientific basis. Practitioners of TT claim to treat 
many medical conditions by using their hands to manipulate a "human energy 
field" perceptible above the patient's skin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 
TT practitioners can actually perceive a "human energy field." DESIGN: Twenty-
one practitioners with TT experience for from 1 to 27 years were tested under 
blinded conditions to determine whether they could correctly identify which of 
their hands was closest to the investigator's hand. Placement of the investigator's 
hand was determined by flipping a coin. Fourteen practitioners were tested 10 
times each, and 7 practitioners were tested 20 times each. MAIN OUTCOME 
MEASURE: Practitioners of TT were asked to state whether the investigator's 
unseen hand hovered above their right hand or their left hand. To show the 
validity of TT theory, the practitioners should have been able to locate the 
investigator's hand 100% of the time. A score of 50% would be expected through 
chance alone. RESULTS: Practitioners of TT identified the correct hand in only 
123 (44%) of 280 trials, which is close to what would be expected for random 
chance. There was no significant correlation between the practitioner's score and 
length of experience (r=0.23). The statistical power of this experiment was 
sufficient to conclude that if TT practitioners could reliably detect a human 
energy field, the study would have demonstrated this. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-
one experienced TT practitioners were unable to detect the investigator's "energy 
field." Their failure to substantiate TT's most fundamental claim is unrefuted 
evidence that the claims of TT are groundless and that further professional use is 
unjustified.

A Close Look at Standards for Therapeutic 
Touch  
 
To the Editor: In their response1 to a letter by Dr Schmidt2 received in 
response to their article,3 Ms Rosa and coauthors state that "Dr Schmidt 
suggests that our test subjects might not have been sufficiently skilled. That 
would be impossible to determine because [Therapeutic Touch (TT)] has no 
accepted standards of training or practice."
This statement is incorrect. Nurse Healers–Professional Associates 
International, Inc (NH-PAI), the official organization for TT, has had 
Standards of Care, Scope of Practice, and Therapeutic Touch Policy and 
Procedure for Health Professionals in place for a number of years. The 
organization was founded in 1977 and has had criteria for practice and 
teaching, including levels of advancement for practitioners, in place for 
more than 8 years.

of TT practitioners. Meaningful standards require demonstrable ability to 
perform a procedure. What NH-PAI refers to as standards requires no such 
demonstration.
To perform TT, a practitioner must detect and manipulate a "human energy 
field." None of the 21 practitioners we tested was able to do so. The 
American Holistic Nurses Association requires no such ability for 
"certification" in Healing Touch (a TT variant), nor do workshops offered by 
NH-PAI, Healing Touch International, or the Theosophical Society of 
America involve any objective determination of ability to practice TT after 
the workshop has been completed. An NH-PAI Web site even stated that 
"Whereas . . . energy flow can not be currently measured" . . . NH-PAI 
opposes certification/credentialing of TT practitioners.2
States that accept continuing education credits for such TT nursing courses 
as those offered by the American Nurses' Association or published in the 
American Journal of Nursing also show no concern for a TT student's actual 
ability to deliver therapeutic benefit. One author advises: "After reading 
about therapeutic touch, you may want to experiment with this modality on 
friends and colleagues before trying it with your patients."3 Can you imagine 
credentialing physicians in this way?

Oil massage credited for helping babies 
grow 
Oil massage improves infant's growth and helps them sleep better, researchers 
from India report. 
DELHI, Mar 01 (Reuters Health) - Oil massage is a time-tested method of infant care practiced all 
over the world and is known to have beneficial effects. "Traditional systems of medicine in India 
advocate oil massage as an integral part of infant care," Dr. K. N. Agarwal writes in a recent issue 
of the Indian Journal of Medical Research. 
Agarwal and his team from the University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi studied the effect 
of oil massage on 125 healthy infants. The infants were approximately 6 weeks of age and were 
divided into five groups. Four groups received oil massage with herbal oil, sesame oil, mustard 
oil, and a mix of mineral oil with vitamin E, respectively. The fifth group served as "control group" 
and did not receive any massage. 
The mothers were taught to massage the legs, back, arms, chest, abdomen, face and head in 
that order. Oil massage was advised for a total of 10 minutes daily and was continued for 4 
weeks. 
On completion of the study, the researchers observed that weight, body length, head 
circumference, girth of arm and leg was increased in the four groups that received oil massage. 
The most significant increase was seen in the group that received massage with sesame oil. The 
length, arm and leg girth in this group were 1 centimeter (cm), 0.9 cm and 0.7 cm more than that 
of the control group, respectively. A significant increase in the blood flow through the femoral 
artery, the main artery supplying the leg, was also seen in this group. 
The investigators also observed that the infants slept better soon after the massage. 
The beneficial effects on growth and sleep are probably due to increased blood flow and increase 
in levels of growth promoting hormones like growth hormone and insulin, the authors explained. 
Vegetable oils such as sesame oil are best suited for massage as they have a beneficial effect on 
growth and blood flow, and are better absorbed as compared to mineral oil, Agarwal and 
colleagues concluded.

Abstract: Objective: To assess the effects of massage therapy alone, or massage therapy 
combined with either exercise training or stress management counseling, on immune function 
and quality of life in HIV-infected persons. Methods: 42 HIV-infected persons were randomized to 
1 of 4 groups: a) once weekly massage therapy; b) once weekly massage therapy and twice 
weekly aerobic exercise training; c) once weekly massage therapy and once weekly stress 
management counseling; d) no therapy (control group). Massage therapy and exercise training 
sessions lasted 45 minutes; stress management counseling sessions were 1 hour in length. 
CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes (number and percent), and NK cells (number and percent) were 
measured by flow cytometry at the beginning and end of the 12 week study. Quality of life 
measures were assessed by survey at the beginning and end of the study. All prescribed 
medications were continued throughout the study. Results: Mean CD4+ count at study entry was 
355 cellsmicroliter (range = 60-1042 cellsmicroliter). The mean entry CD4+ count of the 31 
persons completing the study was 437 cellsmicroliter compared to 169 cellsmicroliter for the 11 
persons not completing the study p is less than 0.005). The percentage of participants completing 
the study was the same across all groups. No significant differences were found among the 
groups on any measure comparing pre-study and post-study values. Conclusions: Short-term 
massage therapy alone or combined with either exercise training or stress management 
counseling did not have any significant effect on immune function or quality of life measures. 
These alternative therapies, while not harmful, should not be used as substitutes for more 
conventional therapies for HIV-infected persons.

School, London.  
The biochemical and clinical response to massage in preterm infants was 
assessed. Eleven stable infants, of 29 weeks' median gestational age, median 
birth weight 980 g, and median postnatal age 20 days, were studied. Blood 
samples were obtained for the determination of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and 
cortisol 45 minutes before the start of massage and approximately one hour 
after completion of massage. Cortisol, but not catecholamine, concentrations 
decreased consistently after massage (median difference -35.8 nmol/l; 95% 
confidence interval - 0.5 to -94.0, Wilcoxon matched pairs). There was a slight 
decrease in skin temperature (median difference -0.36 degrees C, 95% 
confidence interval -0.09 to -0.65) but there was no change in oxygenation or 
oxygen requirement. This study has shown that it is possible to detect an 
objective hormonal change following a supposedly 'non-therapeutic' intervention 
in preterm infants. The development of such methods of assessment are likely to 
be of particular relevance in the extremely immature or ill neonate in whom 
behavioural evaluation cannot play more than a limited part.

Abstract: ISSUE: HIV+ individuals may present with complaints of painful peripheral neuropathy which 
may not adequately respond to pharmacologic therapy. PROJECT: HIV+ individuals with painful peripheral 
neuropathy of the feet who had partial or no improvement in pain after pharmacologic therapy (i.e. narcotic 
analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants and/or serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were referred to occupational 
therapy (OT) for pain management and treatment from 09/11/95 to 10/24/96. OT treatment consisted of 8 
sessions of massage therapy and instruction on a self performed home massage program. No changes in 
medications were made during the duration of the project. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was used to 
measure quality and intensity of pain (scale: 1-10 points) prior to initiating OT massage therapy and after 8 
treatment sessions. RESULTS: Seven HIV+ individuals (4 males; 3 females) with an age range of 28 to 49 
years (mean 39.1) received 8 OT massage therapy treatments over an average of 58 days (range 25 to 126 
days). Five patients reported improvement with a mean decrease in pain of 3.2 (range: 1 to 7). The mean 
CD4 count in the responder group was 183 (range 17-336). One female reported no response to therapy 
(CD4 = 114) and one male reported worsening pain (CD4 = 247). Both non-responders were diabetic. None 
of the responders had diabetes. LESSONS LEARNED: OT massage therapy decreased the intensity of 
painful peripheral neuropathy of the feet in 5 of 5 non-diabetic, HIV+ individuals who had previously had little 
or no response to pharmacologic therapy. Two diabetic HIV+ individuals did not report improvement. OT 
massage therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy in some HIV+ 
individuals.

Oil massage improves infant's growth and helps them sleep better, researchers

DELHI, Mar 01 (Reuters Health) - Oil massage is a time-tested method of infant care practiced all 
over the world and is known to have beneficial effects. "Traditional systems of medicine in India 
advocate oil massage as an integral part of infant care," Dr. K. N. Agarwal writes in a recent issue 
of the Indian Journal of Medical Research. 
Agarwal and his team from the University College of Medical Sciences in Delhi studied the effect 
of oil massage on 125 healthy infants. The infants were approximately 6 weeks of age and were 
divided into five groups. Four groups received oil massage with herbal oil, sesame oil, mustard 
oil, and a mix of mineral oil with vitamin E, respectively. The fifth group served as "control group" 
and did not receive any massage. 
The mothers were taught to massage the legs, back, arms, chest, abdomen, face and head in

of the control group, respectively. A significant increase in the blood flow through the femoral 
artery, the main artery supplying the leg, was also seen in this group. 
The investigators also observed that the infants slept better soon after the massage. 
The beneficial effects on growth and sleep are probably due to increased blood flow and increase 
in levels of growth promoting hormones like growth hormone and insulin, the authors explained. 
Vegetable oils such as sesame oil are best suited for massage as they have a beneficial effect on 
growth and blood flow, and are better absorbed as compared to mineral oil, Agarwal and 
colleagues concluded.

Sixty-nine patients with severe angina pectoris were treated with 
acupuncture, Shiatsu and lifestyle adjustments, and were followed for 2 
years. Forty-nine patients were candidates for coronary-artery bypass 
grafting (CABG), whereas bypass grafting was rejected in the remaining 20 
patients. We compared our endpoint findings with those of a large 
prospective, randomized trial comparing CABG with percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The incidence of death and 
myocardial infarction was 21% among the patients undergoing CABG, 15% 
among the patients undergoing PTCA and 7% among our patients. No 
significant difference was found concerning pain relief between the three 
groups. Invasive treatment was postponed in 61% of our patients due to 
clinical improvement, and the annual number of in-hospital days was 
reduced by 90%, bringing about an estimated economic saving of 12,000 
US $ for each of our patients. Despite the fact that the men in the present 
study, had ! significantly less positive expectations towards the outcome of 
the treatment, when compared to the women, there was no significant 
difference concerning the effect. The study suggests that the combined 
treatment with acupuncture, Shiatsu and lifestyle adjustment may be 
highly cost effective for patients with advanced angina products

Abstract: 
We performed a series of experiments to examine the possibility that a 
theoretically proposed and indirectly empirically confirmed form of 
electromagnetic field emission from living beings appears to modify 
physical characteristics of water. We pursued three types of experiments. 
In the first one, we tried to examine whether and in what way water 
exposed to growing and dying spruce seedlings through a quartz test tube 
(therefore with no chemical contact), influences the germination of seeds 
and the growth of seedlings of the same species. The second type focused 
on the issue of whether and in what way distilled water, equally exposed 
to growing and dying spruce seedlings as well as to different ontogenetic 
phases of mealworm beetle, can be modified and this modification later on 
reproduced through a specially developed method of electrophotography. 
The third type of experiments presented here attempts to find out whether 
an emission from human hands can non-chemically mo! dify the physical 
characteristics of distilled water. Their statistical analysis revealed the 
existence of two different groups of people: those capable of imprinting 
some form of highly reproducible radiation into water and those at most 
capable of imprinting only some sort of highly variable radiation. In the 
future this line of research could provide a scientifically based testing of 
the actual capabilities of the so-called biotherapists to perform this kind of 
unconventional healing. The present experiments also represent further 
indirect evidence for a form of electromagnetic emission from living beings 
and that such emission alters water in an as yet unknown way

Abstract: Objective: To assess the effects of massage therapy alone, or massage therapy 
combined with either exercise training or stress management counseling, on immune function 
and quality of life in HIV-infected persons. Methods: 42 HIV-infected persons were randomized to 
1 of 4 groups: a) once weekly massage therapy; b) once weekly massage therapy and twice 
weekly aerobic exercise training; c) once weekly massage therapy and once weekly stress 
management counseling; d) no therapy (control group). Massage therapy and exercise training 
sessions lasted 45 minutes; stress management counseling sessions were 1 hour in length. 
CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes (number and percent), and NK cells (number and percent) were 
measured by flow cytometry at the beginning and end of the 12 week study. Quality of life 
measures were assessed by survey at the beginning and end of the study. All prescribed 
medications were continued throughout the study. Results: Mean CD4+ count at study entry was 
355 cellsmicroliter (range = 60-1042 cellsmicroliter). The mean entry CD4+ count of the 31 
persons completing the study was 437 cellsmicroliter compared to 169 cellsmicroliter for the 11 
persons not completing the study p is less than 0.005). The percentage of participants completing 
the study was the same across all groups. No significant differences were found among the 
groups on any measure comparing pre-study and post-study values. Conclusions: Short-term 
massage therapy alone or combined with either exercise training or stress management 
counseling did not have any significant effect on immune function or quality of life measures. 
These alternative therapies, while not harmful, should not be used as substitutes for more 
conventional therapies for HIV-infected persons.

CONTEXT: Therapeutic Touch (TT) is a widely used nursing practice rooted in 
mysticism but alleged to have a scientific basis. Practitioners of TT claim to treat 
many medical conditions by using their hands to manipulate a "human energy 
field" perceptible above the patient's skin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether 
TT practitioners can actually perceive a "human energy field." DESIGN: Twenty-
one practitioners with TT experience for from 1 to 27 years were tested under 
blinded conditions to determine whether they could correctly identify which of 
their hands was closest to the investigator's hand. Placement of the investigator's 
hand was determined by flipping a coin. Fourteen practitioners were tested 10 
times each, and 7 practitioners were tested 20 times each. MAIN OUTCOME 
MEASURE: Practitioners of TT were asked to state whether the investigator's 
unseen hand hovered above their right hand or their left hand. To show the 
validity of TT theory, the practitioners should have been able to locate the 
investigator's hand 100% of the time. A score of 50% would be expected through 
chance alone. RESULTS: Practitioners of TT identified the correct hand in only 
123 (44%) of 280 trials, which is close to what would be expected for random 
chance. There was no significant correlation between the practitioner's score and 
length of experience (r=0.23). The statistical power of this experiment was 
sufficient to conclude that if TT practitioners could reliably detect a human 
energy field, the study would have demonstrated this. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-
one experienced TT practitioners were unable to detect the investigator's "energy 
field." Their failure to substantiate TT's most fundamental claim is unrefuted 
evidence that the claims of TT are groundless and that further professional use is 
unjustified.

A Close Look at Standards for Therapeutic 
Touch  
 
To the Editor: In their response1 to a letter by Dr Schmidt2 received in 
response to their article,3 Ms Rosa and coauthors state that "Dr Schmidt 
suggests that our test subjects might not have been sufficiently skilled. That 
would be impossible to determine because [Therapeutic Touch (TT)] has no 
accepted standards of training or practice."
This statement is incorrect. Nurse Healers–Professional Associates 
International, Inc (NH-PAI), the official organization for TT, has had 
Standards of Care, Scope of Practice, and Therapeutic Touch Policy and 
Procedure for Health Professionals in place for a number of years. The 
organization was founded in 1977 and has had criteria for practice and 
teaching, including levels of advancement for practitioners, in place for 
more than 8 years.

of TT practitioners. Meaningful standards require demonstrable ability to 
perform a procedure. What NH-PAI refers to as standards requires no such 
demonstration.
To perform TT, a practitioner must detect and manipulate a "human energy 
field." None of the 21 practitioners we tested was able to do so. The 
American Holistic Nurses Association requires no such ability for 
"certification" in Healing Touch (a TT variant), nor do workshops offered by 
NH-PAI, Healing Touch International, or the Theosophical Society of 
America involve any objective determination of ability to practice TT after 
the workshop has been completed. An NH-PAI Web site even stated that 
"Whereas . . . energy flow can not be currently measured" . . . NH-PAI 
opposes certification/credentialing of TT practitioners.2
States that accept continuing education credits for such TT nursing courses 
as those offered by the American Nurses' Association or published in the 
American Journal of Nursing also show no concern for a TT student's actual 
ability to deliver therapeutic benefit. One author advises: "After reading 
about therapeutic touch, you may want to experiment with this modality on 
friends and colleagues before trying it with your patients."3 Can you imagine 
credentialing physicians in this way?

 An Even Closer Look at Therapeutic Touch 
To the Editor.—As a clinician, I am surprised that THE 
JOURNAL elected to address the important and controversial 
issue of Therapeutic Touch (TT) with such a simpleminded, 
methodologically flawed, and irrelevant study. The experimentsdescribed 
are an artificial demonstration thatsomenumber 
of self-described mystics were unable to “sense the field” of 
the primary investigator’s 9-year-old daughter.1 This hardly 
demonstrates or debunks the efficacy of TT. The vaguely described 
recruitment method does not ensure or even suggest 
that the subjects being tested were actually skilled practitioners. 
More important, the experiments described are not relevant 
to the clinical issue supposedly being researched. Therapeutic 
Touch is not a parlor trick and should not be investigated 
as such. Rather, it is a therapeutic technique that may be discoveredto 
require activeinvolvementbyagenuinely ill patient, 
as the authors themselves convolutedly acknowledge in their 
citation of Krieger’s work. Thus, to demonstrate a child’s participation 
in a magic trick hardly represents an investigation of 
a clinical phenomenon. It is not yet clear if TT will be proven to 
be effective and for which, if any, indications. A serious and 
appropriately designed clinical study is needed to determine its 
efficacy, not an elementary-school science project.

1998;279:1005-1010. 
To the Editor.—Bias occurs when researchers take a holistic 
process, such as TT,1 extract 1 aspect of the process, and measure 
it in a separate situation. When the experiment fails to 
prove what the researchers hypothesized, they then declare 
thewholeprocess worthless.Thefact that this declarationwas 
derived from a sample size of 21 further validates bias on the 
part of the researchers and the editors. Furthermore, to dismiss 
large volumes of research, including double-blind studies, 
as incompetent research means the authors never thoroughly 
evaluated or considered the merit of the articles listed 
as references. Moreover, I care very little whether a practitioner 
can feel energetic exchange successfully in a contrived 
situation such as the experiment set up when I see outcomes 
that the TT process as a whole works. Much about the mechanisms 
of energetic transfer and healing is not understood. To 
take 1 reductionistic experiment and make sweeping statements 
is an irresponsible research process. Encouraging further 
reasonable research intosomeof thesemechanismswould 
be a positive outcome to this negative experience. 
Finally, the authors’ statement, “The American Holistic 
Nursing Association offers certification in ‘healing touch,’ a 
TT variant” is incorrect. The certifying body is Healing Touch 
International, Inc, with headquarters in Lakewood, Colo. 
Healing Touch is a continuing education certificate program 
endorsed by American Holistic Nurses’ Association.

To the Editor.—Members of the greater Kansas City chapter 
of Nurse Healers–Professional Associates are disappointed in 
the authors’ use of a child’s fourth-grade science project to 
support an anti-TT crusade.1 To describe this child’s homework 
as “research” is without foundation since it clearly fails 
to meet the criteria of randomization, control, and valid intervention. 
The “researcher’s” qualifications to conduct research 
and those of her mother are nonexistent. Flagrant violations 
againstTTinclude the fact that “sensing” an energy field is not 
TT but rather a nonessential element in the 5-step process; 
inclusion of many misrepresentations of cited sources; use of 
inflammatory language that indicates significant author bias; 
and bias introduced by the child conducting the project being 
involved in the actual trials. 
As health care professionals, we welcome healthy skepticism, 
as long as it is born of honestyandintegrity. In fact,many 
 TT practitioners start as skeptics but are compelled to continue 
TT after observing many individuals who benefit. Some 
patients acknowledge pain relief. Others experience relaxation, 
accelerated wound healing, and emotional reintegration. 
Through rigorous research, which does not include elementary- 
school science projects,wemayone day gain a more 
thorough understanding of TT. It is unfortunate that JAMA 
would publish articles that deliberately fragment the TT process 
to achieve erroneous results to further the authors’ own 
biases. Therapeutic Touch practitioners, health care professionals, 
and the public deserve better.

To the Editor.—Ms Rosa and colleagues1 claim that “the definitive 
test ofTTis not a clinical trial of its alleged therapeutic 
effects, but a test of whether practitioners can perceiveHEFs 
[human energy fields].” The definitive test of a healing practice 
is whether healing takes place, not whether the practitioners 
have a flawless grasp of the natural forces at work. 
If TT practitioners predicted their success in a study like 
this one, then the test shows only that the TT practitioners do 
not have an accurate grasp on the healing processes at work, 
if any. Perhaps intention of the patient matters quite a lot, 
JAMA, December 9, 1998—Vol 280, No. 22 Letters 1905

even though this is discounted by the practitioners themselves. 
Perhaps a TT practitioner must intend to heal as opposed 
to intend to choose a left or right hand. 
The authors’ sweeping pronouncement that “the claims of 
TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified 
is not appropriate.” Such is evidence of a personal and 
not entirely objective agenda, no doubt consistent with that of 
Quackwatch Inc, the Questionable Nurse Practices Task 
Force, the National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc, and 
the National Therapeutic Touch Study Group. One would expect 
medical professionals to be more concerned with whether 
real healing occurs.

To the Editor.—Research design flaws in the study by Ms 
Rosa and colleagues1 are disturbing given the serious nature 
of study results and the suggestion that TT should no longer 
be offered to patients. First, the authors are not neutral and 
unbiased, nor is the senior author representative of nurse scientists 
with advanced degrees currently conducting research. 
Second, it is questionable whether the sampling methods provided 
a representative sample. “Searching advertisements” 
to obtain a sample is purposive and limits generalizability. In 
addition, the authors did not specify what is meant by “following 
other leads” in recruiting participants. Apparent failure of 
theparticipants to question explication of testproceduresfrom 
a 9-year-old child suggests lack of sophistication. Third, no 
rationale is provided for conducting 2 series of tests, and the 
criteria that guided this design are not mentioned. Moreover, 
during the first testing period, there was a lack of equivalency 
in both the time frames used to assess practitioners and the 
settings in which data were collected. The impact of videotaping 
during the second testing period, a complaint registeredby 
several participants, is not addressed. Fourth, the subtle demand 
characteristic of the procedure for testing the hypothesis 
that practitioners should be able to perceive the HEF of 
the experimenter 100% of the time was not representative of 
the patient-practitioner interaction and glosses over the fact 
 that practitioners generally use bothhandsto assess theHEF. 
In the interest of scientific exploration of the efficacy of TT 
and its mechanism of action and the advancement of quality 
patient care,whichis nevermentionedin the article,weshould 
be cautious in following the recommendations of the authors to 
discard an intervention that many patients throughout several 
decades tell us “works.”2

To the Editor.—I critiqued the study on TT1 and was amazed 
that a research study with so many flaws could be published. 
First, the authors list 129 references of which approximately 
only 50 are primary research studies. Of these studies, the 
majority are master’s theses or dissertations from the 1980s, 
and only 9 references are reports of quantitative studies from 
the 1990s.Acloser look at the methods is even more alarming. 
Possible confounders include the wide range of experience of 
the 21 practitioners, demographic characteristics of the participants, 
and lack of evidence of the depth of their training in 
TT. Although the subject was able to “center,” the researcher, 
a young girl who simply held her hand over the upturned palm 
of the practitioner, violated the entire premise of TT. The 
procedure was conducted in different settings with no control 
of environmental conditions. Even though the trials were repeated, 
the subjects did not change, thus claims ofpowerbased 
on possible repetitions of error are inappropriate. The true 
numbers in groups are 15 and 13, thus making a type II error 
highly probable with a study power of less than 30%. Another 
concerniswhetherparticipants signedinformedconsent documents 
or at least were truly informed as to the nature of this 
study and that publication of its results would be sought beyond 
a report to the fourth-grade teacher.

To the Editor.—No study, including the one on TT,1 can prove 
the nonexistence of a phenomenon. The null hypothesis is a 
useful methodologic convention fabricated for the purpose of 
avoiding experimental error. Proper use of hypothesis testing 
contradicts this article’s “unrefuted evidence that the claims 
of TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified.” 
The only conclusion is that, under the conditions of 
the experiment, a possible truth had not been discovered (a 
type I or a error—rejecting a hypothesis that actually is true). 
Second, the experimental conditions did not approximate 
the technique of TTas it is practiced. Touch therapists repeatedly 
move their hands over the patient with special attention 
given to perceived problem regions. In this study, a static 
condition was evaluated, eliminating the movement component 
thatmaybe critical. Similarly, a type I hypothesis testing 
error would result when evaluating modern security sensors. 
Under static conditions, these sensors would detect human 
presence 0% of the time. The 100% success rate expected in 
this study was far too stringent. There are few, if any, conventional 
medical tests, evaluations, or therapeutics this successful. 
Unconventional therapies should be scrutinized by 
thesamehigh but not untenable standards used for evaluating 
conventional modalities.Anunreasonably strict experimental 
outcome practically ensures a type I error. The research recommendations 
should include further study, and the practice 
recommendations should await a preponderance of accumulated 
evidence.

To the Editor.—The hypothesis tested by Ms Rosa and colleagues1 
 was not directly related to the authors’ conclusions, 
and the methods of analysis and their interpretations were not 
always appropriate. 
First, the hypothesis tested whether the TT practitioners 
could detect which of their hands was being hovered over by 
the investigator. Because practitioners were not instructed to 
performTTon the investigator, the hypothesis cannot test the 
effectiveness of TT. If TT works well in properly designed 
blinded clinical trials, then whether practitioners can detect 
anHEFunder conditions of this study does not seem relevant. 
Second, the study was designed using the binomial distribution. 
However, it was analyzed using the t distribution, although 
the data do not appear to be approximately normally 
distributed and are not continuous. Even so, Table 2 shows 
that for the initial test the alternative hypothesis that µ = 6.67 
was barely rejected at the .05 level of significance.

The authors state that “the odds of getting 8 of 10 trials 
correct by chance alone is 45 of 1024 (P= .04).” This is the 
probability of getting exactly 8 of 10 trials correct. The probability 
of getting 8 or more correct answers of 10 is 56 of 1024 
(5.5%). More important, if the true probability of a successful 
prediction were 0.67 (considered by this article to be a positive 
trial), then the probability of 0 to 4 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.07, and the probability of 0 to 5 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.21. Neither are less than 0.05. Therefore, this study is not 
definitive proof that the true probability of success of the practitioners 
is no better than 0.67. 
Figure 2 in the article includes a frequency distribution of 28 
TT practitioners’ scores, although only 21 unique practitioners 
were tested. More than half the original 15 practitioners did not 
participate in the follow-up test, but no reason was given for 
their absence. The mean of the initial test was 4.67; that of the 
follow-uptestwassmaller, 4.08.Theauthorsstatethatalthough 
several practitioners complained about the presence of the television 
crew during the follow-up test, this was irrelevant. 
Further research, preferably properly designed blinded 
clinical trials, is required to prove or disprove the effectiveness 
of TT.

To the Editor.—As a physician, I remain skeptical about TT as 
an effective technique.Asa scientist, I appreciate the effortsby 
Ms Rosa and colleagues1 to ascertain the validity of some fundamental 
claims ofTTpractitioners. But as a medical historian, 
I think it is essential to remember thatmanyinterventionsnow 
universally regarded as useful were originally proposed at a 
time when their fundamental basis was not only unknown, but 
in some cases unknowable. To consider only a single example, 
when Ignaz Semmelweis proposed handwashing as an intervention 
to combat disease transmission in the mid-1800s, there 
was no consistent theory of disease causation by microorganisms, 
and there did not exist the technological processes necessary 
to demonstrate the existence of those microorganisms 
now considered a major cause of human disease. 
Nonetheless, handwashing was perceived to have an effect 
on human disease. Similarly, when we wish to definitively 
assess the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention today, we 
mustawaitstudies of its effectiveness (or lack thereof) intreatment, 
whether or not we can demonstrate a theoretical basis 
for its effect.

To the Editor.—In describing the theoretical background of 
TT, Ms Rosa and colleagues1 note the similarity to the “animal 
 magnetism” healing techniques of the controversial 18th-century 
physician Franz Anton Mesmer. Indeed, Mesmer’s mysterious 
and magical cures gained such notoriety in Paris that 
in 1784, King Louis XVI appointed a blue-ribbon panel from 
the prestigiousFrenchAcademyof Sciences to formally evaluate 
this “magnetism.” The panel, which included such wellknown 
scientists as Lavoisier, Guillotin, and Benjamin Franklin, 
verified that some patients indeed had benefited, but they 
dismissed this as having something to do with the “imagination,” 
and concluded that “magnetism” was not a real phenomenon. 
2 Unfortunately, this prestigious panel missed the opportunity 
to gain further understanding of the potential of the 
patient-physician relationship, the power of suggestion, and 
recognition of the closely related power of the placebo effect.3 
Ms Rosa and colleagues have elegantly refuted the original 
theoretical basis forTT(with its “human energy field”), but as 
in Mesmer’s case, this does not mean TT cannot be helpful to 
patients. TherapeuticTouchprovides a structure thatmanyill 
patients enjoy: a caring individual with positive intentions 
devotes exclusive attention to the patient in need. Based on 
the current popularity of alternative medicine therapies,4 TT 
is likely to resonate with the belief systems of many patients. 
Particularly if TT is practiced only on willing patients by 
volunteerswhochargenofees, 
there shouldbenoadverse effects. 
If we acknowledge that the interaction between individuals 
can be a powerful force, then TT can offer an appropriate 
structure to harness its positive potential to provide some 
psychological comfort to ill patients.

The authors state that “the odds of getting 8 of 10 trials 
correct by chance alone is 45 of 1024 (P= .04).” This is the 
probability of getting exactly 8 of 10 trials correct. The probability 
of getting 8 or more correct answers of 10 is 56 of 1024 
(5.5%). More important, if the true probability of a successful 
prediction were 0.67 (considered by this article to be a positive 
trial), then the probability of 0 to 4 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.07, and the probability of 0 to 5 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.21. Neither are less than 0.05. Therefore, this study is not 
definitive proof that the true probability of success of the practitioners 
is no better than 0.67. 
Figure 2 in the article includes a frequency distribution of 28 
TT practitioners’ scores, although only 21 unique practitioners 
were tested. More than half the original 15 practitioners did not 
participate in the follow-up test, but no reason was given for 
their absence. The mean of the initial test was 4.67; that of the 
follow-uptestwassmaller, 4.08.Theauthorsstatethatalthough 
several practitioners complained about the presence of the television 
crew during the follow-up test, this was irrelevant. 
Further research, preferably properly designed blinded 
clinical trials, is required to prove or disprove the effectiveness 
of TT.

To the Editor.—As a physician, I remain skeptical about TT as 
an effective technique.Asa scientist, I appreciate the effortsby 
Ms Rosa and colleagues1 to ascertain the validity of some fundamental 
claims ofTTpractitioners. But as a medical historian, 
I think it is essential to remember thatmanyinterventionsnow 
universally regarded as useful were originally proposed at a 
time when their fundamental basis was not only unknown, but 
in some cases unknowable. To consider only a single example, 
when Ignaz Semmelweis proposed handwashing as an intervention 
to combat disease transmission in the mid-1800s, there 
was no consistent theory of disease causation by microorganisms, 
and there did not exist the technological processes necessary 
to demonstrate the existence of those microorganisms 
now considered a major cause of human disease. 
Nonetheless, handwashing was perceived to have an effect 
on human disease. Similarly, when we wish to definitively 
assess the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention today, we 
mustawaitstudies of its effectiveness (or lack thereof) intreatment, 
whether or not we can demonstrate a theoretical basis 
for its effect.

To the Editor.—In describing the theoretical background of 
TT, Ms Rosa and colleagues1 note the similarity to the “animal 
magnetism” healing techniques of the controversial 18th-century 
physician Franz Anton Mesmer. Indeed, Mesmer’s mysterious 
and magical cures gained such notoriety in Paris that 
in 1784, King Louis XVI appointed a blue-ribbon panel from 
the prestigiousFrenchAcademyof Sciences to formally evaluate 
this “magnetism.” The panel, which included such wellknown 
scientists as Lavoisier, Guillotin, and Benjamin Franklin, 
verified that some patients indeed had benefited, but they 
dismissed this as having something to do with the “imagination,” 
and concluded that “magnetism” was not a real phenomenon. 
 2 Unfortunately, this prestigious panel missed the opportunity 
to gain further understanding of the potential of the 
patient-physician relationship, the power of suggestion, and 
recognition of the closely related power of the placebo effect.3 
Ms Rosa and colleagues have elegantly refuted the original 
theoretical basis forTT(with its “human energy field”), but as 
in Mesmer’s case, this does not mean TT cannot be helpful to 
patients. TherapeuticTouchprovides a structure thatmanyill 
patients enjoy: a caring individual with positive intentions 
devotes exclusive attention to the patient in need. Based on 
the current popularity of alternative medicine therapies,4 TT 
is likely to resonate with the belief systems of many patients. 
Particularly if TT is practiced only on willing patients by 
volunteerswhochargenofees, 
there shouldbenoadverse effects. 
If we acknowledge that the interaction between individuals 
can be a powerful force, then TT can offer an appropriate 
structure to harness its positive potential to provide some 
psychological comfort to ill patients.

In Reply.—Advocates of TT postulate that an HEF exists. 
Can such an entity be measured or perceived? Do any welldesigned 
studies show a beneficial effect against any health 
problem? Our article addressed all of these points. If TT practitioners 
could sense an HEF, they should be able to sense 
whether they are near an experimenter’s hand. None of the 
tested practitionersdemonstratedsuch ability.Noneobjected 
to the study’s design before they were tested. Proponents still 
offer no alternative testable hypothesis or protocol. Nor have 
any stepped forward to attempt to demonstrate the existence 
of an HEF, even though a million-dollar reward is available.1 
Dolores Krieger, PhD, RN, the founder of TT, has stated 
repeatedly that its practitioners senseanenergy field. In 1987, 
she wrote, “In Therapeutic Touch, assessment involves the 
use of the hands in a sensitive search of the healee’s energy 
field, for indications of energy imbalance. Actually, the received 
impression is really an extension of the sense of touch 
as we usually think of it.”2 We leave it to JAMA readers to 
decide for themselves whether it is possible to manipulate an 
“energy field” with their hands if they cannot tell where it is. 
MsCollins asserts that 21 practitionersweretoofewto yield 
valid results. However, our power analysis showed that this 
numberwasmorethan adequate to test our simple hypothesis. 
Therapeutic Touch proponents never have objectively demonstrated 
that they can detect an HEF. Unless they do, it is 
reasonable to assume that none exists. 
Dr Schmidt suggests that our test subjects might not have 
been sufficiently skilled. That would be impossible to determine 
because TT has no accepted standards of training or 
practice. We approached every practitioner we could identify 
in our (Colorado) community. Nearly all agreed to be tested, 
and none was reliably able to detect the location of Emily’s 
hand.3 We see no reason to believe that they were less competent 
than practitioners elsewhere. 
Dr. Palmer is correct that the probability of getting 8 ormore 
correct is slightly higher than the probability of getting exactly 
8 correct. However, this point does not affect the interpretation 
of the test data. Her discussion of the “true probability of a 
successful prediction” being 0.67 is disposed of by our power 
analysis, which she does not contradict. Moreover, TT postulates 
that an HEF can be sensed and manipulated for therapeutic 
benefit. All of our subjects claimed to do this routinely. 
For this to be true, the detection rate would have to be 100%. 
Our study centered on the performance of 28 subjects, not 280 
independent trials. Since a normal distribution was expected 
under the null hypothesis,webelieve the t-distribution was the 
appropriate analytic tool. Our final conclusion was not based 
solely on the hypothesis that practitioners would detect the 
experimenter’s “energy field.” It also took into account—based 
on our literature analysis—that TT has never been shown to 
“work well in properly designed trials.” All 15 original participants 
were invited to be retested. Seven said they were unable 
to attend on the specific day. Only 1 said she didn’t feel she could 
perform“oncamera.”Nocomplaintsweremadeaboutthe presence 
of TV cameras before or during testing. 
DrBlankarguesthatTTmighthavemeritbecauseit is physically 
harmless, might exert a useful placebo effect, and offers 
“the full and unhurried attention of a caregiver.” We believe it 
is inherently harmful to misrepresent placebos as effective 
treatment. Moreover, there are much better ways for nurses 
and clinicians to provide beneficial attention to patients. 
DrIreland expresses concern about discarding an intervention 
that many patients say works. Anecdotal evidence is not 
sufficient to determine whether something works. Our extensive 
literature search found no evidence that TT provides any 
health benefit. Therapeutic Touch proponents still have not 
 stated any grounds on which their claims may be considered 
valid, nor have they presented any reasonable justification for 
TT’s continued professional use.

 Abstract 
 
Purpose/Objectives: To test the effects of foot reflexology on 
anxiety and pain in patients with breast and lung cancer.  
 
Design: Quasi-experimental, pre/post, crossover.  
 
Setting: A medical/oncology unit in a 314-bed hospital in the 
southeastern United States.  
 
Sample: Twenty-three inpatients with breast or lung cancer. The 
majority of the sample were female, Caucasian, and 65 years or 
older; had 12 or fewer years of education and an annual income of 
$20,000 or more; and were receiving regularly scheduled opioids 
and adjuvant medications on the control and intervention day.  
 
Methods: Procedures included an intervention condition (foot 
reflexology to both feet for 30 minutes total by a certified 
reflexologist) and a control condition for each patient (with at least a 
two-day break). No changes were made in patients' regular 
schedule or medications.  
 
Main Research Variables: Anxiety and pain.  
 
Findings: Following the foot reflexology intervention, patients with 
breast and lung cancer experienced a significant decrease in 
anxiety. One of three pain measures showed that patients with 
breast cancer experienced a significant decrease in pain.  
 Conclusions: The significant decrease in anxiety observed in this 
sample of patients with breast and lung cancer following foot 
reflexology suggests that this may be a self-care approach to 
decrease anxiety in this patient population.  
 
Implications for Nursing Practice: Professionals and lay people 
can be taught reflexology. Foot reflexology is an avenue for human 
touch, can be performed anywhere, requires no special equipment, 
is noninvasive, and does not interfere with patients' privacy.

 Key Points 
 
1. Foot reflexology is a form of foot massage that targets 
points on the foot believed to correspond to parts of the 
body.  
2. With an increased interest in complementary therapies, foot 
reflexology may appeal to oncology nurses because of the 
potential relaxation effects.  
3. Study findings indicate that foot reflexology has a possible 
positive effect on anxiety reduction. Effects on pain 
reduction are less clear.  
4. Nurses interested in using foot reflexology should undergo 
training and certification.  
 
 
 
 
Many patients living with cancer experience anxiety, and 75% of 
patients with advanced cancer experience pain (U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, 1994). Patients must manage their 
anxiety and pain as chronic problems.  
 
Patients with cancer often try alternative therapies (e.g., massage, 
reflexology, therapeutic touch, herbs, special diets) (Dossey, 
Keegan, Guzzetta, & Kolkmeier, 1995; Montbriand, 1994). However, 
patients often make these choices based on limited information 
about the efficacy of the therapies (Montbriand, 1995). Healthcare 
providers must conduct more research about these therapies if they 
are to help patients make wise choices about them (Montbriand, 
1993).

  Reflexology 
 
Reflexology is a form of foot massage designed to harmonize bodily 
functions and thus have a healing and relaxing effect (Tappan, 
1978). Reflexology is based on the premise that "there are reflex 
areas in the feet and hands that correspond to all of the glands, 
organs, and parts of the body" (Byers, 1983, p. 11). Reflexology has 
been used since ancient times to promote relaxation (Booth, 1994; 
Byers; Dobbs, 1985). In recent years, it has been used as an 
alternative or complementary therapy to relieve stress and tension, 
improve the blood supply, and promote homeostasis (Dossey et al., 
1995; Micozzi, 1996). Explanations for its effects are based on 
several theories. For example, the energy theory proposes that 
organs communicate via an electromagnetic field and reflexology 
assists energy to recirculate through blocked pathways. The lactic 
acid theory states that lactic acid is deposited as microcrystals in the 
feet and reflexology crushes the crystals and allows for the free flow 
of energy. The theory of proprioceptive nervous receptors states that 
a connection exists between the areas of the feet and the body 
organs and that reflexing the feet affects the organs. Foot 
reflexology produces its relaxing effect by relieving tension and 
stress related to physical problems. This relaxation affects the 
autonomic response, which, in turn, affects the endocrine, immune, 
and neuropeptide systems (Dossey et al.). Finally, the psychological 
explanation states that reflexology is simply a method of showing 
care and concern for patients (Dobbs). Reflexology's relaxing effect 
supported this study.  
 
No research has examined reflexology as a treatment for patients 
with cancer, although studies have tested the effects of other 
nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., massage) on patients' anxiety 
and pain (Barbour, McGuire, & Kirchhoff, 1986; Crowther, 1991; 
Ferrell, Cohen, Rhiner, & Rozek, 1991; Ferrell-Torry & Glick, 1993; 
Meek, 1993; Weinrich & Weinrich, 1990; Wilkie, Lovejoy, Dodd, & 
Tesler, 1988). Patients with cancer cited massage as a method of 
nonpharmacologic pain control they used (Barbour et al.). While 
observing patients' pain-control behaviors, researchers noted the 
use of more pain-control behaviors than patients reported (Wilkie et 
al.), which supports inclusion of participant observation in research 
designs examining patients with cancer who are experiencing pain. 
A pilot study found that male patients with cancer experienced a 
significant decrease in pain after a 10-minute massage (Weinrich & 
Weinrich). Although pain was not significantly decreased one to two 
hours following massage, massage was advocated as a short-term 
nursing intervention. Ferrell-Torry and Glick found similar results 
after patients with cancer received a 30-minute massage. These 
nine men demonstrated a decrease in physiologic indicators and 
improved self-reports of their perception of pain and anxiety. Meek 
confirmed positive results after male and female patients enrolled in 
hospice received a three-minute back massage. The patients' 
decrease in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and increase in 
skin temperature were evidence of their increased relaxation.  
 
Ferrell et al. (1991) reported that patients with cancer experienced 
decreased pain specifically after foot massage, but no other
 research about reflexology and patients with cancer has been 
reported. However, reflexology treatments during an eight-week 
period in a randomized controlled study decreased premenstrual 
signs and symptoms (including anxiety) significantly more in an 
intervention group than in the placebo group (n = 35) (Oleson & 
Flocco, 1993). Omura (1994) used a procedure to map organ 
representation on the hands and feet of 10 subjects. Omura did not 
report statistical significance but claimed physiologic results based 
on an anatomic design. Reflexology has been used as an alternative 
or complementary therapy to relieve stress and tension, improve the 
blood supply, and promote homeostasis (Dossey et al., 1995; 
Micozzi, 1996). This article reports a study of the effects of 
reflexology on anxiety and pain in patients with cancer.

 Methods 
 
This study was a quasi-experimental, pre/post, crossover trial, with 
patients serving as their own control (Daly, Bourke, & McGilvray, 
1991). This design is appropriate when a treatment such as 
reflexology produces an immediate effect that may disappear after 
the treatment is removed. The patients were randomized to two 
groups: Group A (receiving reflexology on the first contact) and 
Group B (receiving reflexology on the second contact). The 
researcher used a coin toss to determine which patients were 
assigned to the control group first and which patients were assigned 
to the intervention group first. The researcher then alternated 
assignment of control and intervention for each of the patients, 
ensuring that every other patient was assigned to Group A or Group 
B. Anxiety and pain were measured prior to the intervention, at the 
beginning of the control time (a 30-minute time period during a day 
without the intervention), following the intervention, and at the end of 
the control time.  
 
Setting and Sample 
 
Patients were on an 18-bed medical/oncology unit in a large regional 
hospital in the southeastern United States. All patients with lung or 
breast cancer were included in the study during a 20-week period if 
they were 21 years or older, spoke English, and gave informed 
consent. Only patients with breast and lung cancer were chosen to 
limit the types of chronic cancer-related pain (somatic or visceral). 
Payne (1990) and Portenoy (1990) recommended limiting the types 
of pain. Because different cancers have different pain 
characteristics, limiting the types of pain makes the population more 
homogenous. A nurse researcher asked the patients with breast and 
lung cancer who met the criteria (determined through chart review) 
to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for anxiety (Herman, 
1990). If patients reported any anxiety on the VAS, they were asked 
to participate in the study. Patients with cancer who reported no 
anxiety on the VAS were excluded. Patients who had surgery within 
the past six weeks, open skin wounds on their feet, a foot tumor or 
foot metastasis, or radiation treatment to the feet also were excluded
 to separate patients experiencing chronic pain from those 
experiencing acute pain (City of Hope National Medical Center and 
Beckman Research Institute, 1993). Patients who received radiation 
to the site of pain were excluded. Patients with dementia or 
peripheral neuropathy also were excluded to ensure their responses 
were accurate (McDonald & Bruera, 1990). In addition, patients who 
had recent surgery were excluded to differentiate chronic cancer-
related pain from acute surgical pain (Coyle & Foley, 1987).  
 
The oncologists required a medical consultation before the 
researcher was allowed to seek participation in the study from 
patients exhibiting any possible symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. 
Reflexology is not contraindicated for patients with deep vein 
thrombosis, but the required medical consultation was physician 
preference. As in other studies (Booth, 1994; Byers, 1983), patients 
with lower limb circulatory problems (e.g., phlebitis, gallstones, 
kidney stones) did not receive foot reflexology to the areas of the 
foot associated with the diseased areas of the body but received 
foot reflexology to other areas of the foot. Avoiding reflexology to the 
affected areas of the foot that are associated with other problem 
areas of the body is a safety precaution to prevent, for example, 
stones or possible emboli from moving and causing complications.  
 
Most of the patients on the medical/oncology unit experienced 
chronic cancer-related pain for which pain medications were 
ordered. Twenty-four patients agreed to participate in the study; 
however, one patient died before the reflexology intervention, 
leaving a final sample of 23. Even though all of the patients 
experienced pain at some time during their hospitalization, they did 
not always experience it during the time of measurement for the 
study.  
 
Intervention 
 
The International Institute of Reflexology, which uses the Original 
Ingham Method, trained and certified the researcher as a 
reflexologist. Before patients were enrolled in the study, reflexology 
was described explicitly to them through a written protocol and a 
form that illustrated the areas that would be reflexed (i.e., areas on 
the foot related to a body part or organ that are stimulated by 
pressure of the reflexologist's thumb or forefinger).  
 
Foot reflexology was chosen because most of the patients were 
receiving IV fluids through the hands or arms, making hand 
reflexology less appropriate. Of the 30-minute reflexology session, 
15 minutes were spent reflexing the areas of the feet corresponding 
to areas of patients' self-reported pain and organs or body parts 
where cancer sites were located (to promote homeostasis) (Byers, 
1983; D. Byers, personal communication, November 1, 1996). If 
patients reported no pain, the reflex areas on the feet associated 
with the organs or body parts where the cancer was located were 
reflexed. The specific areas reflexed for breast cancer and lung 
cancer (i.e., the balls of the feet and on top of the feet over the balls) 
are identical. Byers defined helper areas as areas that, when 
reflexed, may have a direct effect on the afflicted areas and are
 used as reinforcements. These areas were reflexed to aid the 
specific area of the pain or cancer sites. Helper areas included the 
pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands to boost the immune response 
to stress (D. Byers, personal communication, November 1, 1996). If 
swelling was a problem, areas of the feet corresponding to the 
lymphatics were reflexed. The area corresponding to the solar 
plexus was reflexed on all patients as part of the relaxing 
techniques. Relaxing techniques, administered at the beginning and 
end of the session, comprised 10 minutes of the 30-minute 
reflexology session. Relaxing techniques consisted of a back-and-
forth movement of the reflexologist's palms on the outer edges of the 
patients' metatarsals and an ankle-loosening technique in which the 
reflexologist's palms were used to reflex the outer edges of the 
patients' ankles. Five minutes were devoted to reflexing the entire 
area of the feet to ensure that all areas of the body were covered.  
 
Thirty-minute foot reflexology sessions are recommended (Byers, 
1983; Oleson & Flocco, 1993; Rick, 1986; Tappan, 1978) and were 
administered using a crossover design during one of two 
consecutive researcher visits with each patient, between 7 am and 7 
pm. Half of the patients received reflexology first and then served as 
their own control. The other half of the patients served as their own 
control first and then received reflexology. Hospital-brand lotion was 
applied to the feet at the end of the session (lotion was withheld 
during the reflexology to prevent the reflexologist from slipping over 
an area). The reflexologist responded to the patients' comments or 
questions during the session.  
 
No intervention was used during the 30-minute control time. The 
researcher was not present during this time. At least 48 hours 
elapsed between the reflexology intervention and the control time. 
The mean time between the intervention and control was 2.4 days, 
with a maximum interval of 7 days. Patients continued their regular 
routine of rest and activity during that time period.  
 
Instruments 
 
Two instruments were used to measure anxiety and pain. The VAS, 
the simpler of the two instruments, was used to measure anxiety 
and administered first so that the procedure for completing a VAS 
could be explained. The VAS for anxiety is a 10-cm line with verbal 
anchors at each end stating "not anxious at all" to "the most anxious 
I have ever been" (Cline, Herman, Shaw, & Morton, 1992; McGuire, 
1988). The VAS score ranged from 0-100. The instrument has been 
standardized and is reliable (Cline et al.).  
 
The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) (Melzack, 
1987) was used to measure pain. It contains descriptor words 
representing the sensory dimension of the pain experience 
(throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-
burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting). Four descriptors 
(tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) depict the 
affective dimension. The words are ranked according to intensity 
from 0-3 (none, mild, moderate, severe) (Melzack). The Present 
Pain Intensity (PPI) component of the SF-MPQ and a VAS measure
 the pain intensity. The PPI scores range from 0-5 and are 
accompanied by descriptor words (no pain, mild, discomforting, 
distressing, horrible, and excruciating).  
 
The SF-MPQ takes only two to five minutes to administer and 
correlates highly with the sensory, affective, and total indices of the 
longer McGill Pain Questionnaire. It is sensitive to therapies such as 
analgesic drugs, epidural blocks, and transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (Melzack, 1987). Validity and reliability of the SF-
MPQ have been established with patients with chronic cancer pain 
(Dudgeon, Raubertas, & Rosenthal, 1993). Correlations between the 
long and short forms ranged from r = 0.81-0.97 for the descriptive 
words.  
 
Demographic data collected included age, gender, race, education, 
and income. Other pertinent information included diagnoses 
(specific type of cancer, metastasis sites, and diagnoses other than 
cancer) and, based on a previous study (Stephenson, 1990), 
medications (pain and other medications) taken within the last 24 
hours.  
 
Data Analysis 
 
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System and 
provided descriptive statistics, correlations, and univariate analysis. 
The Wilcoxon and Signed-Rank tests were used for analyses 
because of the highly skewed distribution of data.  
 
Group A and Group B each were pretested and post-tested at two 
separate times. Medications were treated as categorical variables. 
Demographic data were collapsed into two categories for each 
variable to enhance the clarity of the data.

 Results 
 
Of the total sample of 23 patients, 13 (56.5%) had breast cancer and 
10 (43.5%) had lung cancer (see Table 1). Of the 13 patients with 
breast cancer, 10 had metastases. Of the 10 patients with lung 
cancer, 5 had metastases.  
 
Medications given to the sample on control and intervention days 
were not significantly different. On the control and intervention days, 
14 patients (61%) received opioids. On the control day, six patients 
(26%) received nonopioid analgesics, and, on the intervention day, 
seven patients (30%) received nonopioid analgesics.  
 
Anxiety 
 
Anxiety scores, used to measure the effects of foot reflexology on 
anxiety, were significantly lower after foot reflexology in both groups 
of patients and between the two groups. Table 2 indicates post-test 
scores minus pretest scores with the reflexology intervention and the
 differences between anxiety scores of the control group and 
following reflexology treatments.  
 
Pain 
 
The 13 patients with breast cancer (11 reporting pain) experienced a 
significant decrease in pain following foot reflexology as measured 
by the descriptive words of the SF-MPQ (see Table 3). Because 
only two patients with lung cancer reported pain, results from this 
group of subjects could not be calculated. The differences in pain 
between the groups as measured by the PPI and VAS were not 
significant.

 Discussion 
 
Patients with breast and lung cancer experienced significantly 
decreased anxiety following reflexology. Patients with lung cancer 
experienced the greatest decrease in anxiety. Because the majority 
of these patients were male, gender was a confounder with cancer 
type.  
 
In addition, patients with breast cancer experienced significantly 
decreased pain, as measured by the descriptive words of the SF-
MPQ, following reflexology. Additional study is required to determine 
the effects of foot reflexology on pain as measured by the intensity 
sections of the SF-MPQ, the VAS, and the PPI. The fact that the 
mean pain score on the VAS was only 20.13 for the sample as a 
whole before reflexology and most patients with lung cancer 
reported no pain at the time of measurement may explain, in part, 
the nonsignificant decrease in pain in either group. Other patients 
were taking medications to manage their pain.  
 
The findings of this study are consistent with the literature regarding 
reflexology (Oleson & Flocco, 1993; Omura, 1994). Reflexology can 
be used to decrease anxiety and pain in patients with cancer. 
Despite the fact that the patients in this study were taking drugs to 
manage pain, 61% reported pain at some time during the study. 
Reflexology also can be an avenue for increasing human touch, 
which is a basic human need. Reflexology can be performed 
anywhere, requires no special equipment, is noninvasive, and does 
not interfere with patients' privacy. Some patients in this study were 
concerned that their feet might have an odor. Washing patients' feet 
first and applying cornstarch if the feet are moist can remedy this 
concern.  
 
Future research studies are needed to compare reflexology with 
other complementary/alternative therapies (e.g., massage, healing 
touch, relaxation response). Repetitive sessions of reflexology might 
be studied for a cumulative effect. Research on cost-effectiveness 
and gender and aging differences associated with reflexology would 
enhance the efficacy of practitioners' incorporation of reflexology into 
their practice. Research to ensure that the best nonpharmacologic
 methods are matched with different types of pain will contribute to 
the expanding knowledge of pain.  
 
Limitations of this study were the small sample size (considering that 
only two of the patients with lung cancer reported pain during the 
measurement) and the unusually high representation of males with 
lung cancer. The crossover design allowed the 23 patients to be 
their own control, which lessened the problem of a small sample 
size. Because only 11 patients with breast cancer measured pain 
that was reportable, future studies would benefit from a pain score 
minimum as part of the inclusion criteria. Replication with a larger 
sample of a single cancer type is necessary to limit the type of pain. 
Studies testing nonpharmacologic interventions for anxiety and pain 
continue to be a challenge but will provide vital information for 
healthcare providers to manage symptoms of patients with cancer.  
 
Nurses who wish to incorporate reflexology in their practice can 
study it in the book Better Health With Foot Reflexology (Byers, 
1983). Certification in reflexology through the International Institute 
of Reflexology involves 100 hours of study (books, study guides, 
videos, and seminars), 100 hours of documented practice of 
reflexology sessions, and a written and practical examination about 
the Ingham Method of Reflexology. Certification is the best way to 
ensure proper performance of the technique and can be obtained in 
a minimum of nine months. Practitioners can obtain more 
information about reflexology by contacting International Institute of 
Reflexology, 5650 1st Avenue North, St. Petersburg, FL 33710-7912

COHEN, Chapman University School of Law, Anaheim, California 92660 USA writes that 
European providers of complementary medicine may be surprised by the formal strictures faced 
by their American counterparts. 
Discussion: One major hurdle to the practice of holistic medicine in the USA is the statutory 
prohibition against the unlicensed practice of medicine. Because state statutes define "medicine" 
very broadly, this creates a legal risk for unlicensed providers of holistic health care, as well as for 
licensed providers whose services may be deemed to exceed their legislatively authorised scope 
of practice, or who cross into the diagnosis and treatment of disease. 
Results: This review focuses upon the legal status of non-licensed (or "unenfranchised") 
providers rather than the scope of practice. For such providers the seeking of occupational 
licensure could provide a measure of protection against medical practice acts, as well as 
elevating their professional competence and prestige. Many holistic providers, however, prefer to 
remain outside regulatory schemes, and thus mandatory licensure, title licensure and registration 
offer some means of upgrading professional status and the achievement of state sanction for 
professional practice.

RANKIN-BOX, De Montfort University, Cheshire UK writes that due to increased interest among 
the general public and health professionals, there appears to be an assumption that the use 
within the health care setting of complementary therapies such as massage, homoeopathy, 
aromatherapy, reflexology and acupuncture is widespread. To date, however there have been no 
national research studies conducted to validate this assumption. The author conducted an 
informal survey to assess nurses' use of complementary therapies. 
Methods: The study attempted to identify the range of practices and the extent of their use by 
nurses who are members of the Royal College of Nursing Complementary Therapy Forum 
(RCNCTF) in the UK. A convenience sample was used and a semi-structured questionnaire was 
inserted into the group's bi-annual newsletter sent to all members of the RCNCTF (n = 1662). 
Only 178 nurses completed and returned the questionnaire, merely a 9.3% response rate, which 
was partially expected, given the informal nature of the survey and that it was in the form of an 
insert into a newsletter. 
Results: The majority of respondents were aged between 41-50 years, contrary to expectation. 
The 6 main therapies practised were, in order of use): massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, 
relaxation, visualisation and acupuncture. The 3 most common practice areas, including both the 
NHS and the private sector, were: in the community, palliative care and oncology. 
Complementary therapies were more commonly practised in the private sector as part of formal 
working practices, in contrast to nurses working in the NHS, where complementary therapies 
formed less than 20% of their formal nursing care, and where, when used, was often in addition 
to their daily nursing care. 
Conclusions: These results indicate that nurses are practising complementary therapies less than 
generally assumed. The therapies commonly practised are a broader range then those generally 
presented as the primary complementary therapies, namely homoeopathy, acupuncture, herbal 
medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. Because this survey was from a convenience sample 
focussing upon a self-selected group who were members of the RCNCTF, the findings cannot be 
generalised. However there is a need to identify the national use of complementary therapies 
within the health care setting.

therapies. Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(4): 97-9. Aug 1997. 
WEST, Warwick Hospital UK writes that the availability of acupuncture in midwifery within the 
National Health Service (NHS) has yet to become widespread and that Warwick was one of the 
first hospitals in the UK to offer acupuncture when this service it was set up in September 1993. 
Methods: Acupuncture is offered to patients, alongside conventional treatment, from 6 weeks into 
their pregnancy until 6 weeks following birth. Patients are referred by midwives, GPs or 
consultants, and all professionals work as a team of which the acupuncturist is a complementary 
part. A range of pregnancy-related conditions may be treated and is ideal for patients reluctant to 
take drugs during pregnancy. Diagnosis and treatment are based upon holistic principles rather 
than on symptoms. Because of the risks involved, extreme care is taken when treating during 
pregnancy and certain acupuncture points are prohibited. 
Discussion: The author writes that the immediate and continued success of the acupuncture 
provides the hope that pregnancy and post-natal women elsewhere in the UK may have access 
one day to this ancient holistic treatment without having to pay for it privately.

BAKER, Aromatherapy Organisations Council, Leicester UK writes that although aromatherapy is 
used more and more alongside conventional medicine in hospitals and via GP referrals, doctors 
and other health professionals are concerned regarding training standards, codes of conduct and 
standards of practice. These concerns led to the establishment of a Working Party in 1990 whose 
aim is was to promote a single body for aromatherapy practice. 
Discussion: The range of training courses on offer may appear to be confusing, which is 
compounded by aromatherapy massage courses taught by many further education colleges 
under the health and beauty umbrella, which claim to offer recognised qualifications in 
aromatherapy. This has given rise to the questions: What is a qualified aromatherapy?; What are 
recognised training standards for the profession? Which professional associations are 
recognised? Is there a self-regulating and governing body for aromatherapy and, if so, what is its 
remit? What is the situation with regard to Europe?  
Conclusions: The author describes the role and remit of the Aromatherapy Organisations Council 
(AOC), who are committed to the identification of unified training standards and the maintenance 
of a register of training establishments.

Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(3): 77-80. June 1997. 
VICKERS, Research Council for Complementary Medicine, London UK writes in this review (20 
references) that while there is evidence that massage and aromatherapy may have benefits, 
practitioners make a great number of claims regarding the clinical effects of their treatments. 
Discussion: The author claims that these claims are often presented in the literature as simple 
statements of fact, often with no attempt to explain the basis upon which the claim is made. Even 
when authors do occasionally refer to the scientific literature, this is often done inadequately; in 
some cases the papers cited do not support the claims made. Some authors have given personal 
experience as the source of their knowledge; however it is difficult to generalise statements from 
individual experience. These many inconsistencies found in the massage and aromatherapy 
literature, including different properties conferred upon the same oil, further substantiate the 
allegation that the knowledge basis of these therapies in unreliable. 
Conclusions: Practitioners must develop a critical discourse by which they can evaluate 
knowledge claims.

COMMENTS: It would appear that individuals from all sides of the complementary divide agree 
that there are misconceptions regarding the availability, use and efficacy of complementary 
therapies. Particularly crucial appears to be the need to increase the standards of training and the 
requirement to base claims upon actual research.

 BOTTING, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Glamorgan, Wales UK writes that 
public interest regarding complementary therapies continues to grow, and that many nurses and 
midwifes incorporate reflexology, aromatherapy and massage into their clinical practice. 
Methods: There are concerns that the effectiveness of these therapies has not been fully 
demonstrated and the author reviews the literature (45 references) regarding the efficacy of 
reflexology. 
Results: Anecdotal evidence is presented and concerns regarding the prevalence of personal 
beliefs and experiences within the literature are voiced and the requirement for research evidence 
advocated. Additionally, there is a critical review of published research studies, focussing upon 
issues relating to methodology, including the use of randomised controlled trials, to determine the 
efficacy of therapies such as reflexology.

STYLES, Paediatric Unit, St Mary's Hospital, London UK writes that aromatherapy is a valuable 
means of maintaining optimum health, especially when the health problem is stress-related. 
Methods: Hospitalisation is a potentially stressful experience as documented by research. The 
author reviews (28 references) how massage and aromatherapy may be of benefit to hospitalised 
children, especially those infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 
Discussion: Nurses should encourage self-healing by "putting the patient in the best condition for 
nature to act". The author states that aromatherapy massage has the potential to achieve this 
through inducing relaxation and reducing the stress of hospitalisation and proposes the 
application of this skill as an extension of the nursing role.

Nurs Midwifery 3(1): 16-20 Feb 1997. 
KACPEREK, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK conducted a survey to determine the 
views of patients regarding the potential value of aromatherapy massage as an out-patient 
service. 
Methods: A structured questionnaire was distributed to 240 patients. 71% (n = 170) of the 
patients responded. 
Results: The majority of respondents replied that they would use an aromatherapy massage out-
patient service, subject to various factors which could affect their decision. These considerations 
included: having a trained practitioner, reputable premises, the gender of the practitioner, cost of 
treatment and confidence with aromatherapy massage. Additionally the medical profession 
appeared to be influential, with many respondents preferring to be referred by a GP or consultant. 
These concerns appeared to be due to lack of knowledge and awareness of aromatherapy 
massage and complementary therapies in general. Also, there appeared to exist a reliance upon 
the medical profession to be responsible for taking health care decisions. 
Kacperek L. Patients' views on the factors which would influence the use of an aromatherapy 
massage out-patient service. Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(2): 51-7. Apr 1997. 
COMMENTS: This is a very interesting result indeed, in particular the willingness of patients to 
have aromatherapy massage if referred by a GP or consultant. It isn't clear whether being 
referred by a GP meant that treatment would be paid for by the NHS, in which case cost could 
well be a factor. Probably if GPs or consultants advised aromatherapy massage, this type of 
treatment would be taken more seriously as a legitimate therapeutic option. Certainly there is a 
huge potential benefit in the incorporation of such therapies into mainstream medical treatment. 
KATZ, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital, London UK writes that although nurses and 
midwives may not be involved directly in the treatment of menopausal patients, they are uniquely 
positioned to support and advise patients regarding the menopause. 
Discussion: Many women want to become informed about how to deal with symptoms and fears 
related to going through the menopause. The author states that homoeopathic treatment, which 
deals with both physical symptoms and emotional responses can be used during the menopause, 
either as an alternative to or alongside hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
Conclusions: In addition to exploring homoeopathic approaches to the treatment of menopausal 
symptoms, the author questions the current trend of promoting HRT.

MACKERETH, Biodynamic Massage, Reflexology and Therapeutic, Burnage, Manchester UK 
writes that he has received supervision following the completion of his biodynamic massage 
therapy training, in compliance with the requirement of the Code of Conduct for the Association of 
Holistic Biodynamic Massage Therapists. 
Discussion: The author writes of the difficulties associated with arranging supervision since most 
of the supervisors were based in London or Cambridge and not in the North West of England. 
Various types of supervision were attempted, including one-to-one supervision over the 
telephone, supported by 3-monthly meetings with a London-based supervisor. The author was 
able to obtain monthly one-to-one supervision locally four years ago and is now a member of a 
small supervision group who meet for 3 hours monthly. He more recently became a supervisor 
working with nurses working in complementary therapies and/or developing clinical supervision. 
Conclusions: The author explores the concept of supervision with the intent of sharing his 
experiences and promoting discussion within the therapeutic nursing profession.

WHITMARSH, Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital, Scotland reported a case of migraine without 
aura, which was unresponsive to 5 years of conventional medical treatment. 
Methods and Results: Consultation with a homoeopathic physician with extensive experience in 
the diagnosis and treatment of headaches, resulted in the prescription of a single homoeopathic 
remedy which was absolutely effective for this case. 
Discussion: This report is offered as an open and retrospective study, comparing the best 
conventional migraine therapy with appropriate homoeopathic therapy in the same patient.

KELNER and WELLMAN, Institute for Human Development, Life Course and Aging, University of 
Toronto, Ontario compared the social and health characteristics of patients from five groups of 
practitioners: 1) family physicians (used as baseline group); 2) chiropractors; 3) acupuncturist/ 
traditional Chinese medicine doctors; 4) naturopaths; and 5) Reiki practitioners. 
Methods: Data were gathered in a large Canadian city during 1994-1995. Face-to-face interviews 
were carried out with 300 patients (60 patients from each treatment group). 
Results: The most evident social and health differences occurred between patients of family 
physicians and those of alternative practitioners. There were also significant differences between 
the various groups of alternative patients. Reiki patients had a higher level of education and were 
more likely to be employed in managerial or professional positions than patients from alternative 
groups. 
Conclusions: The profiles presented indicate that users of alternative therapies ought not to be 
regarded as a homogeneous population, and that almost all patients of alternative practitioners 
also consult family physicians. The emerging pattern is one of multiple uses: patients choose the 
type of practitioner they believe can best help their particular health problem.

KENNER, Department of Parent-Child Health Nursing, College of Nursing and Health University 
of Cincinnati, Ohio USA review (17 references) writes that fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are not new conditions, but are the focus of more attention from 
research conducted in these fields. The author writes that FMS and CFS are primarily women’s 
health problems and that in some instances there may be a genetic predisposition to these 
 conditions, which may have emotionally and physically devastating impacts upon sufferers’ lives. 
The treatment plan should be holistic, interdisciplinary and include alternative therapies to enable 
the client and family to be truly supported and assisted to cope with such chronic conditions.

FIELD T and colleagues, Touch Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine, 
Florida 33101, USA studied the therapeutic benefits of massage therapy or relaxation therapy for 
children with asthma.  
Methods: 32 children (16 x 4-8 years old and 16 x 9-14 years old) suffering from asthma were 
randomly assigned to either the massage or relaxation group. The parents of the children were 
taught to give one therapy or the other for 20 minutes prior to bedtime every night for 30 days.  
Results: The younger children receiving massage demonstrated an immediate decrease in 
behavioural anxiety and cortisol levels following the massage. Additionally, there was an 
improvement over the course of the study regarding their attitude toward asthma and peak air 
flow and other pulmonary functions. The older children receiving massage reported lower anxiety 
following the massage. Their attitude toward asthma also improved over the course of the study, 
but there was improvement of only one measure of pulmonary function – forced expiratory flow: 
25% to 75% improvement. The reason for the diminished therapeutic benefit in the older children 
is unknown.  
Conclusions: Daily massage improves airway calibre and control of asthma in children.

VICKERS and colleagues, Research Council for Complementary Medicine, London UK 
investigated potential research bias by analysing the results of clinical trials originating in various 
countries.  
Methods: Sources were abstracts from Medline, January 1966-June 1995. Two separate studies 
were conducted. The first comparing clinical outcome of subjects receiving acupuncture 
compared to groups receiving placebo, no treatment to a nonacupuncture intervention. The 
second study compared the results of randomised or controlled trials of interventions apart from 
acupuncture published in China, Japan, Russia/USSR or Taiwan with those published in 
England. Determination of inclusion, outcome and classification of trial by country of origin were 
performed by blinded reviewers.  
Results: 252 of 1085 abstracts of acupuncture trials met the inclusion criteria. All trials which 
originated in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan were positive as were 10 of 11 studies 
published in Russia/USSR. In the nonacupuncture intervention studies, 405 of 1100 abstracts 
met the inclusion criteria. Compared to China (99%), Japan (89%), Russia/USSR (97%) and 
Taiwan (95%), where the results of the test treatment were superior to controls, only 75% of trials 
published in England gave the test treatment as superior to control. No trial published in China or 
Russia/USSR found a test treatment to be ineffective.  
Conclusions: Certain countries publish an unusually high proportion of positive results, which 
could be the result of publication bias. Researchers undertaking systematic reviews need to 
consider how to manage research data from these countries.

controlled trials.Control Clin Trials 19(2):159-66 April 1998. 
HILSDEN and colleagues, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, 
Alberta, Canada studied the use of complementary therapies by patients suffering from 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 134 patients with IBD (98 Crohn’s 
disease; 34 ulcerative colitis and 2 indeterminate) by means of a mailed structured questionnaire. 
The response rate was 70%. The use of complementary medicine by the respondents was 
examined using logistic regression. The second phase of the study explored the beliefs and 
perceptions of 14 users of complementary medicine, who were interviewed.  
Results: 51% of patients had used complementary therapies during the previous 2 years. 33% of 
patients were using complementary therapies currently, and one-half of these patients were using 
complementary therapies to manage their IBD. The most commonly reported therapies were the 
use of vitamins and herbal products. Two independent predictors of complementary medicine use 
 were duration of disease greater than 10 years and history of hospitalisation. The most commonly 
cited reasons for seeking complementary medicine were side effects and lack of effectiveness of 
conventional treatment. 62% of these patients told their physicians about using complementary 
therapies.  
Conclusions: Use of complementary medicine is common in patients suffering from IBD, 
particularly among patients with a longer duration of disease or history of hospitalisation.

VERHOEF and PAGE, Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Calgary. investigated the knowledge, opinions and referral behaviour of family 
physicians regarding massage therapy.  
Methods: The authors conducted a random, cross-sectional mailed survey of Alberta family 
practice physicians (n = 300). The survey was composed of questions regarding 
sociodemographic and practice characteristics, perceived knowledge of massage therapy, 
opinions regarding its usefulness, government regulations of massage therapy and referral 
behaviour.  
Results: 161 physicians (54%) completed the questionnaire. 68% of respondents stated they had 
minimal or no knowledge of massage therapy; however, despite this low level of knowledge, 83% 
believed that massage therapy was a useful adjunct to their own practice. In fact, 71% had 
referred patients to massage therapists and 72% perceived an increasing demand from their 
patients for massage therapy. About ½ of the physicians surveyed supported government 
regulation of massage therapy.  
Conclusions: Physicians showed a discrepancy between their knowledge of massage therapy 
and their opinions of, and referrals to, massage therapists. Those physicians who referred 
patients to massage therapists generally held more positive opinions and had greater knowledge 
of the discipline.

WONG and colleagues, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada studied how Chinese 
patients consulting family physicians in Vancouver, Canada used traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), in particular Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture.  
Methods: The authors conducted a bilingual (English and Chinese) survey among 4 family 
practices (932 patients or family members) with predominantly Chinese patients in Vancouver. 
The main outcome measures were demographic characteristics, frequency and reasons for 
visiting a family physician, Chinese herbalist or acupuncturist and their choice of practitioner if 
affected by one of 16 common conditions.  
Results: The study population was mainly Chinese and immigrants to Canada. 28% of 
respondents used Chinese herbal medicine, with more then one visit during the last year; 
another18% were past users of Chinese herbal medicine. 7% of respondents currently used 
acupuncture; another 8% had used acupuncture in the past. The use of Chinese herbal medicine 
varied significantly according to age, sex, immigrant status and ethnicity. Acupuncture use varied 
significantly only by age. The main reasons for consulting Chinese herbalists were infection 
(41%), respiratory problems (11%) and rheumatologic problems (10%), whereas acupuncturists 
were consulted almost exclusively for rheumatologic problems (80%).  
Conclusions: The use of TCM along with consulting family physicians was very popular among 
this predominantly Chinese study population. Patients with acute health problems, such as 
influenza, consulted both their family physicians and Chinese herbalists, often in quick 
succession. However, those patients suffering more chronic conditions, including rheumatologic 
diseases, were more likely to start using TCM following repeat visits to their family physicians.

physicians use these therapies? Can Fam Physician 44: 1009-15. May 1998. 
ANDREWS and colleagues, Faculty of Medicine, University of Adelaide, South Australia, 
Australia studied the nature and prevalence of alternative therapies used by children with asthma.  
Methods: A questionnaire describing the use of alternative therapies was completed by the 
parents of 51 children with asthma aged 1-6 years in South Australia.  
Results: About 55% of children used alternative therapies for asthma management. The therapies 
 which were most commonly used were massage, relaxation, diet and vitamin therapy. The 
authors did not find any significant difference in age, asthma severity, length of time since 
diagnosis or presence of another illness amongst children who did or did not use alternative 
therapies. 
Conclusions: A substantial proportion of children with asthma attending paediatric clinics use 
alternative therapies. Paediatricians need to be aware of this and be prepared to discuss 
alternative therapies with parents, which may facilitate a more open doctor-patient relationship 
and provide better management of the children’s asthma. 
Andrews L et al. The use of alternative therapies by children with asthma: a brief report. J 
Paediatr Child Health 34(2): 131-4 April 1998. 
Comments: It is abundantly clear from the breadth of the above reported studies, that people of 
all ages, from all over the world, suffering from a variety of health problems, are using a variety of 
alternative therapies, usually in conjunction with conventional allopathic treatment. The study by 
Vickers et al makes for worrying reading, in that it seems to be far too good to be true that 
virtually all research from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and Russia report positive results, 
whereas research from the UK reports positive results in just 75% of the cases.

VALLANCE, Medical School Registry, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK 
reviews (149 references) the evidence for the efficacy of homoeopathy. He writes that 40% of 
GPs in the Netherlands practise homoeopathy, and that with over 100 homoeopathic medical 
schools, homoeopathy is practised in India, and that in the UK, 42% of GPs refer patients to 
homoeopaths. 
Results: Two recent meta-analyses indicated that homoeopathy has added effects over those of 
placebo. However, despite this evidence there is a backdrop of considerable scientific scepticism, 
mainly due to the ultra-high dilution (UHD) of homoeopathic remedies, such that there are no 
molecules of the original substance present in the final remedy. The author suggests how the 
scientific community could respond to this challenge and writes that evidence has been 
conducted upon a diverse range of homoeopathic assays, including immunological, physiological, 
behavioural, biochemical and clinical. UHD effects has attracted the attention of physicists who 
have speculated upon their physical mechanisms. The author includes a critique of several 
experiments which formed the Benveniste affair, sparked off by the Nature article suggesting the 
existence of UHD effects of IgE upon human basophils. The author states that this is a paradigm 
example of how a controversial phenomenon can divide the scientific community and argues that 
there is as yet insufficient evidence to drive rational scientists to a consensus view regarding 
UHD effects, even if they possessed knowledge of all the evidence. Difficulty in publishing high-
quality UHD research in mainstream conventional journals precludes a fair assessment of UHD 
effects. However, given that the existence of UHD effects could revolutionise science and 
medicine, the author argues that possible UHD effects warrant serious investigation by 
conventional scientists and serious attention by scientific journals.

CARROLL and SEERS, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, University of Oxford, The Churchill, 
UK conducted a systematic review (54 references) of published randomised controlled trials 
regarding the effectiveness of relaxation techniques in the management of chronic pain. 
Methods: The authors searched MEDLINE, psychLITT, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain 
Relief Database. Only randomised controlled trials of relaxation techniques in chronic pain were 
included in this review. Studies investigating the effects of relaxation in combination with other 
interventions were not considered. 9 studies involving 414 patients met the predefined inclusion 
criteria and are critically appraised. Lack of quantitative data in the primary studies precluded 
meta-analysis. The studies involved patients suffering from a range of chronic pain conditions; the 
 most common pain outcome used was the McGill Pain Questionnaire. 
Results: 4 studies showed a significant difference in pain outcomes in favour of relaxation for the 
pre- and post-treatment assessments, but there were few statistically significant differences 
reported in favour of relaxation with between treatment comparisons. 3 studies reported 
statistically significant differences in favour of relaxation compared to the other treatment groups. 
For rheumatoid arthritis the McGill Pain Questionnaire scores were significantly lower for patients 
receiving relaxation compared to those in the control group. For ulcerative colitis there were 
significant differences reported in 6 out of 7 pain outcome measures in favour of progressive 
muscle relaxation compared to the waiting list control group. In one of the two cancer pain 
studies, relaxation produced significantly lower pain sensation scores compared to control 
patients. Two studies reported significant differences for the experimental control groups rather 
than for relaxation. 
Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to confirm that relaxation reduces chronic pain. Many 
studies with both positive and negative results have suffered from methodological inadequacies, 
and the authors make recommendations for future research regarding the effectiveness of 
relaxation techniques for chronic pain.

27(3): 476-87 Mar 1998. 
 
SEERS and CARROLL, Royal College of Nursing Institute, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK 
reviewed (60 references) the effectiveness of relaxation techniques used alone for management 
of acute pain following surgery and during procedures. 
Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review, searching MEDLINE, psychLITT, CINAHL, 
EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which 
yielded 7 studies involving 362 patients. 150 patients received active relaxation as the sole 
intervention. Outcome measures were pain and psychological factors. A lack of primary data 
precluded meta-analysis. 
Results: 3 of the 7 studies showed significantly less pain sensation and/or pain distress in 
patients receiving relaxation. 4 studies did not demonstrate any difference. There was weak 
evidence supporting the use of relaxation for acute pain; however, this evidence was 
inconclusive, with many of both the positive and negative studies suffering from methodological 
inadequacies. 
Conclusions: The authors state that well designed and executed randomised controlled trials are 
required before the clinical use of relaxation for acute pain management can be firmly 
underpinned by high quality research evidence. The authors further recommend that until this 
evidence is obtained, that the clinical use of relaxation for acute pain settings be carefully 
evaluated and not used as the main treatment for the management of acute pain.

GOOSSENS and colleagues, Institute for Rehabilitation Research, Hoensbroek, The 
Netherlands. M.Goossens@IRV.nl. conducted a 3-year cost-effectiveness study and compared 
the efficacy of several types of rehabilitation programmes for chronic low back pain. 
Methods: The authors compared a combined operant programme plus cognitive/relaxation 
programme with an operant programme plus attention-control. They then compared both 
programmes with a waiting-list control group and with operant rehabilitation provided by the same 
rehabilitation centre. 148 patients suffering from chronic low back pain were randomly assigned to 
the various programmes. Economic endpoints were the costs of the programme and other health 
care utilisation, costs for the patient, and the indirect costs associated with production losses due 
to low back pain.  
Results: The results of this 3-year study demonstrated that the addition of a cognitive component 
to an operant treatment did not result in significant cost differences nor improvements to quality of 
life compared to the operant treatment alone. Compared to the common individual rehabilitation 
therapy, it was concluded that the same effects can be achieved at the same or lower costs with 
a shorter, more intense standardised group programme. The operant treatment alone was more 
effective than providing no treatment in the waiting-list control group. 
 Goossens ME et al. Health economic assessment of behavioural rehabilitation in chronic low 
back pain: a randomised clinical trial. Health Econ 7(1): 39-51 Feb 1998. 
Comments: As the above studies demonstrate, there is a considerable amount of research 
focussed upon determining the efficacy of complementary therapies in many health problems, 
with the intent of proving or disproving many commonly-held assumptions such as the use of 
relaxation for pain relief, and the inclusion of a cognitive component within a back pain treatment 
programme.

McPARTLAND and SOONS, Vermont Alternative Medicine, Middlebury USA estimated the 
number of alternative/holistic practitioners in Vermont. 
Methods: The authors scanned advertisements in yellow pages, newspapers, magazines and 
brochures and performed word-of-mouth canvassing. 
Results: The authors located 897 Vermonters who derived most of their income as a practitioner 
of at least one of 97 types of alternative medicine and therapy. The majority of practitioners were 
female, and most practised more than one type of healing. The most prevalent practitioners were 
bodyworkers, followed by chiropractors, acupuncturists, herbalists and holistic psychotherapists. 
On a per-capita basis, there is 1 alternative practitioner per 652 Vermonters or 153 practitioners 
per 100,000 population. This census almost equals that of Vermont’s population of medical 
doctors (MDs). 
Conclusions: Extrapolation of this data from Vermont to a nationwide estimate suggests that there 
are over 403,000 full-time alternative practitioners practising in the United States.

prevalence, patterns of use, and national projections. J Altern Complement Med 3(4): 337-42.

Comments: These statistical projections are staggering, particularly since most of the 
practitioners are practising fairly “conventional” therapies – chiropractic, acupuncture, herbalism – 
i.e., professions fairly compatible with those of the medical profession. 
 
WIRTH and CRAM, Healing Sciences Research International, Orinda, California, USA analysed 
three studies regarding complementary healing methods. 
Methods: The series of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concerned sEMG 
electrode placement upon specific neuromuscular paraspinal centres (cervical C4, thoracic T6 
and lumbar L3), as well as the frontalis region, as these sites correspond to chakra centres as 
described in Eastern texts. The hypothesis is that the sEMG assessment procedure had the 
potential to provide objective, quantifiable correlates for healing effects, and assess energy flow 
through the chakras during the healing treatment. 
Results: These were the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocols to evaluate 
neuromuscular paraspinal measures with differing healing interventions. Although measurement 
protocols were similar between experiments, the results varied and appeared to be linked to 
 either the meditational experience of the subjects or to the particular healer(s). These results are 
considered preliminary in nature, but they indicate a potentially objective scientific correlation to 
healing interventions. 
Conclusions: More research is required to establish the sEMG assessment procedure as a 
reliable correlative measure for healing effects and  
to determine whether consistent replicative treatment effects can be demonstrated, independent 
of the specific population or practitioner.

BLAIS and colleagues, Groupe de recherche interdisciplinaire en santé, Université de Montréal, 
Quebec Canada. blaisr@ere.umontreal.ca. compared the demographic characteristics, health 
profile and utilisation of medical services between users and non-users of alternative medicine in 
the province of Quebec, Canada. 
Methods: The authors linked respondents’ survey replies with medical service records from the 
1987 health survey. Users of alternative medicine practitioners were matched by diagnosis and 
area of residence with those who visited physician practitioners (non-users). 
Results: There were differences in age, activity, education and income between users and non-
users of alternative medicine. Following adjustments for age, education and income, both groups 
had similar health profile however users of alternative medicine had made fewer medical visits in 
the previous year. 
Conclusions: Alternative medicine attracts a particular group of people and more research is 
required in order to understand the reasons people visit alternative rather than conventional 
practitioners of medicine. 
Blais R et al. How different are users and non-users of alternative medicine? Can J Public Health 
88(3): 159-62. May-Jun 1997. 
Comments: There is a seemingly endless procession of research studies from countries all over 
the world, all directed at finding out why people wish to use non-drug, more natural treatment 
approaches, and what distinguishes these people from those who use conventional medicine. It 
seems to me quite simple and straightforward that the majority of people, given the choice, and 
being able to afford to pay for treatment, would prefer gentler therapies free from major side 
effects. Unfortunately, this is not presently an option for the majority of non-affluent people when 
most complementary treatments are not available on the NHS. However, times are changing, and 
within the next 5-10 years, therapies such as acupuncture, homoeopathy, massage, 
aromatherapy, nutritional and herbal therapy and osteopathy will become increasingly available 
through the NHS. 
 
LANGLEY and BHATTACHARYYA, Center for Pharmaceutical Economics, College of Pharmacy, 
University of Arizona, Tucson USA discuss the problem of increasing costs (and decreasing 
returns) in the treatment of patients within health care systems. 
Methods: The implications of such a situation are studied for: 1) allocation of patients to 
alternative drug therapies 2) the proportions of patients treated within the disease area to total 
patient population as a function of equilibrium conditions for maximised health care outcomes, 
given alternative assumptions regarding the existence of budget constraints upon resources 
allocated to the disease area. The authors state that the reason for considering these issues is 
that such a model and its driving assumptions are in marked contrast to those underlying the 
traditional approach to cost-effectiveness modelling. 
Results: In traditional cost-effectiveness analysis, there is an assumption that costs and 
outcomes exhibit constant returns to scale and that the process of patient selection and 
characteristics of the treating population do not need to be taken into account. This analysis 
shows that once the assumption of constant returns is abandoned, any assessment of the net 
impact of therapeutic interventions may be made only within an equilibrium, or comparative static, 
 framework subject to budget constraints in which cost functions which drive patterns of switching 
between therapies are specified. Under such conditions, the traditional, clinical-trial-based notion

EDWARDS, University Support Centre, University of Western Australia, Australia. 
medwards@cyllene.usa.edu.au. writes that the Zen Buddhist tradition involves a number of 
meditation and instructional techniques with strong phenomenological and theoretical 
connections with the experience of loss and the grief process. 
Results: The author utilised experiences which occurred during personal encounters with 
individuals – 3 of whom were disabled – in a grief counselling setting. There were several points 
of connections identified, including: 1) a heightened awareness of the embodied nature of 
experience 2) the importance and dialogue and relationship for healing and transformation 3) the 
focus on process as opposed to outcome 4) the importance of the process of life review 5) a 
confrontation with the nature of absence and emptiness and 6) being present to what is 
experienced rather than focusing on the need for change. The authors discusses these findings in 
terms of Ken Wilber’s full-spectrum model of human development and enlarges upon their 
implications for professional and non-professional support persons for people experiencing grief.

PEREZ and SUAREZ, Catedra de Farmacologia, Facultad de Odontologia, Universidad de 
Buenos Aires, Argentina had previously reported the antimicrobial activity of plants used in 
Argentine folk medicine against a variety of micro-organisms. 
Methods: The present study reported the screening of 11 of these plants against the pathogenic 
fungus Candida albicans. Aqueous extracts were checked against fungus cultures using agar-
well diffusion technique. 
Results: 5 of the extracts showed antifungal activity.

NORHEIM, Institute of Community Medicine, University of Tromso Norway reviews (29 
references) the adverse effects of acupuncture as recorded in papers published in journals on the 
Medline database during the period 1981-94. METHODS: There were a total of 125 papers which 
were detected by the keywords acupuncture adverse effects. The author excluded articles without 
case reports, leaving 78 reports which were reported in the present article. RESULTS: Over 14 
years, there were a total of 194 patients reported with adverse effects of acupuncture, with the 
most common mechanical organ injury attributed to pneumothorax, and hepatitis the main 
infection. Acupuncture treatment is claimed to be responsible in the death of 3 patients, one from 
bilateral pneumothorax, a second from complications from endocarditis and the third from severe 
asthma while under acupuncture treatment. The majority of adverse effects from acupuncture 
seemed to be due to insufficient basic medical knowledge, low hygienic standards and 
inadequate acupuncture education. CONCLUSIONS: This paper confirms the adverse effects of 
acupuncture under certain circumstances. However, serious adverse effects are few and 
acupuncture can generally be considered a safe treatment.

COMMENTS: In an ideal world, one would hope to find no reports of adverse effects from any 
 given treatment. However, we all know that we don’t live in an ideal world, and that if we consider 
any one given procedure, say giving injections, or dealing with ingrown toenails, or lancing boils, 
or even taking antibiotics, we have all heard of horror stories pertaining to reactions, infections or 
allergic drug reactions to standard medical procedures. These statistics, often representing 
hundreds or thousands of individuals, are regularly published in medical handbooks and 
occasionally in popular books or magazine articles regarding iatrogenic illness and they make 
sobering reading. Seen in this context, the fact that over a 14-year period the author was only 
able to find 125 papers representing 193 patients from all over the world reported to have 
experience adverse effects in Medline is quite astonishingly clear proof that acupuncture is 
indeed safe, provided that the practitioner is properly trained in basic medical knowledge, 
acupuncture and observe high standards of safety and hygiene. 
 
SUN, Nanjing College for Population Administrators, China studied the anti-obesity effects of 
acupuncture and influence upon water and salt metabolism. METHODS: The author studied in 75 
patients with simple obesity (12 people with oedema, 33 without oedema) the changes in 
symptoms and signs, obesity indices, blood sodium, blood potassium, and mOsm of plasma and 
urinary aldosterone prior to and following acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: The total effective 
rate of anti-obesity treatment for one month was 89.3%. Prior to acupuncture, blood sodium and 
aldosterone levels of the patients with oedema were significantly higher than in normal individuals 
or those patients with oedema however blood potassium and mOsm of plasma of the patients 
with oedema were significantly lower than normal individuals or patients without oedema. 
Following acupuncture treatment, concentrations of blood sodium and aldosterone decreased 
considerably and blood potassium and mOsm of plasma increased significantly in the patients 
with oedema. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that acupuncture treatment had not only 
a good anti-obesity effect, but that acupuncture improved water and salt metabolism of obese 
patients by regulation of nervous system and body fluid.

LEVIN, colleagues and JONAS, National Institute for Healthcare Research, Rockville MD, USA 
summarises the deliberations of the Quantitative Methods Working Group convened by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), in support of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). 
METHODS: The working group had as its remit to identify methods of study design and data 
analysis applicable to empirical research regarding complementary and alternative medicine. This 
remit was wide-ranging and included the evaluation of alternative therapies, investigation of the 
basic science of the complementary medical systems, studies of health promotion, disease 
prevention and health services research. RESULTS: The working group produced a summary list 
of 7 recommended methodological guidelines regarding research on alternative medicine. Their 
recommendations stressed the robustness of existing research methods and analytic procedures 
despite the considerable unconventionality of alternative medicine. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast 
to the statements of researchers and practitioners of alternative medicine, established 
methodologies – experimental trials, observational epidemiology, social survey research – and 
procedures for data analysis – analysis of variance, logistic regression, multivariate modelling 
techniques – are satisfactory for addressing the majority of study issues related to alternative 
medicine, ranging from clinical research regarding therapeutic efficacy to basic scientific research 
regarding mechanisms of pathogenesis and recovery.

CARLSTON and colleagues, Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of 
California, San Francisco, USA. mcarlston@aol.com write that the use of therapies outside of 
 mainstream Western medicine, known as complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) is rapidly 
increasing in the United States. They write that despite evidence of physician interest and 
willingness to refer to CAM provides, there is presently little information regarding medical 
education in complementary practices. The authors conducted a survey to assess the frequency 
and nature of alternative medicine instruction within US medical schools and family practice 
residency programmes. METHODS: A 16-question survey was mailed to all US medical school 
family medicine department chairmen and non-university-based family practice residency 
programme directors regarding current instruction in alternative medicine, planned instruction and 
programmes being considered. RESULTS: The response rate was 78% about 30% of all 
respondents currently teaching, 6% starting to teach and 6.3% considering teaching some form of 
alternative medicine. CAM instruction was most common in the Northeast and Rocky Mountain 
regions, and is predominantly elective (72.2%), although content and teaching methods vary 
widely. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative medicine is starting to establish a presence in US medical 
schools and family practice residency programmes, with subjects varying widely in content and 
format.

HE and colleagues, Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway, studied the 
effects of acupuncture upon smoking reduction and cessation. METHODS: 46 healthy men and 
women, of mean age of 39 years, smoking 20 +/- 6 cigarettes daily over a period of 23 +/- 8 years 
and who wished to cease smoking participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned 
to two groups as follows: 1) Group I received acupuncture treatment at points used for anti-
smoking (test group TG) 2) Group II received acupuncture treatment at points assumed to have 
no effect for smoking cessation (control group CG). Each participant replied to questionnaires 
regarding his or her smoking habits and attitudes prior to each treatment and following the last 
treatment. Concentrations of cotinine, thiocyanate, peroxides and fibrinogen were measured prior 
to the first and following the last acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: Daily cigarette consumption 
declined during the treatment period in both groups however the reduction was larger for TG than 
for CG. 31% of those in TG had ceased smoking compared with none in CG. In TG 
concentrations of cotinine and thiocyanate were significantly reduced following the treatment 
period, compared to the no significant reductions in CG group. The taste of tobacco worsened 
during the treatment period in both groups, but the effect was more pronounced for TG than CG. 
Desire to smoke fell significantly in both groups following treatment the reduction was larger for 
TG than CG. There were no significant changes in concentrations of peroxides and fibrinogen 
during the treatment period for either group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggests 
that acupuncture may help to motivate smokers to reduce or quit smoking. Different acupoints 
appear to have different effects for smoking cessation and reduction.

ERNST and PITTLER, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, 
University of Exeter, Exeter UK conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the 
effectiveness of acupuncture for dental pain. METHODS: Computerised literature searches were 
performed of Medline, Embase, CISCOM and Cochrane Library databases additionally, experts 
were solicited to contribute their own published and unpublished material. All studies were 
evaluated and rated according to a standardised criteria with particular attention to the 
methodological quality (Jadad score) of the research performed. RESULTS: 16 trials, mostly 
using acupuncture in a clinical situation, predominantly for pain relief during dental procedures, 
were assessed. The majority of these investigations suggested that acupuncture is more effective 
than control treatment only 4 trials implied the contrary. All the experimental studies were 
positive. Of the more recent 11 trials which were randomised, only 4 were negative. In 8 
randomised trials, in which there was present some degree of blinding, only 1 was negative. In 
the 7 studies which were sham controlled in addition to being blinded and randomised, all but 1 
were positive. In one of the studies with the highest Jadad score, with 40 volunteers receiving ear 
or sham acupuncture, the real acupuncture group experienced an 18% increase in their pain 
 threshold to experimental pain. In another study with a high Jadad score, in which 
electroacupuncture or sham was used while drilling, a remarkable placebo-response of 100% of 
patients resulted, with no differences between the acupuncture and sham groups. 
CONCLUSIONS: These data from these studies suggest that acupuncture is effective for pain 
relief for dental operations following surgery or during experimentally induced dental pain. The 
mechanisms for this may relate to the blocking afferent pathways, effects upon endogenous 
opioids and inhibitory effects upon efferent pathways. The methodological details and 
heterogeneity across this literature limits the conclusions which can be made. Further research 
should consider optimal acupuncture technique and acupuncture’s relative efficacy compared to 
conventional pain relief methods.

COMMENTS: It was not very long ago that certain respected authorities were disputing and even 
ridiculing the notions of acupuncture meridians and the clinical efficacy of acupuncture. Regular 
readers of this research section will be familiar with the considerable volume of research, mainly 
emanating from China, regarding the application of acupuncture for many important diseases, 
including stroke, hypertension, diabetes, emesis and pain relief. The mechanisms for 
acupuncture’s efficacy are being researched in earnest, so that before long, we may be 
understand why acupuncture works, which may help to convince extreme doubters who can not 
believe anything unless a rational explanation is advanced.

BERDEN and colleagues, BION, Institute for Bioelectromagnetics and New Biology, Ljubljana, 
Slovenia studied whether electromagnetic field emission from living beings could modify physical 
characteristics of water. METHODS: The authors followed three types of experiments: 1) Whether 
and in which way water exposed to growing and dying spruce seedlings through a quartz test 
tube, and hence with no chemical contact, influences germination of seeds and growth of 
seedlings of the same species 2) Whether and in which way distilled water equally exposed to 
growing and dying spruce seedlings and various stages of mealworm beetle can be modified, 
with this modification later reproduced via a specially developed technique of electrophotography 
3) Whether an emission from human hands can modify, non-chemically, the physical 
characteristics of distilled water. RESULTS: Statistical analyses demonstrated two different 
groups of people: 1) those capable of imprinting some form of highly reproducible radiation into 
water, and 2) others at most capable of imprinting only some type of highly variable radiation. 
CONCLUSIONS: This line of research could provide a scientifically based testing of actual 
capabilities of so-called biotherapists performing unconventional healing. These experiments also 
demonstrate further indirect evidence for a form of electromagnetic emission from living beings 
and that such emission alters water in an as yet unknown way. 
Berden M et al. A possible physical basis for the healing touch (biotherapy) evaluated by high 
voltage electrophotography. Acupunct Electrother Res 22(2): 127-46. 1997. 
COMMENTS: The quest to find and prove the existence of electromagnetic emissions from living 
beings is one of the central tenets (holy grail) of healing and energy-based medicine. The ability 
of highly dilute substances to imprint or somehow alter water is of course at the centre of the 
controversy regarding the efficacy of homoeopathy. These questions will not go away soon. 
WATSON and WATSON, University of Bradford, review the therapeutic benefits of massage and 
its relationship and relevant to orthodox therapies. RESULTS: The majority of studies regarding 
the effects of massage upon patients' wellbeing have been conducted by non-nursing 
researchers. The authors suggest that nurse-based research would make an important 
contribution to holistic care approach. The write that interest in and use of complementary 
therapies has grown over recent years and that massage appears to be of particular interest to 
nurses, as it involves close, intimate, contact in which nurses are often engaged as part of their 
daily work with patients. The benefits and problems associated with massage are explored.

BUSS and colleagues, Maastricht University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Nursing 
Science, The Netherlands write that the prevention of pressure sores is a major concern of 
rehabilitation nurses. BACKGROUND: Over the years, a number of methods have been used to 
prevent pressure sores. One of the most commonly used methods is massage of bony 
prominences and pressure areas. However, according to the majority of contemporary clinical 
guidelines, massage is to be avoided. The authors review (30 references) through a search of the 
literature, the extent to which such guidelines are based upon research findings regarding the 
effectiveness of massage in preventing pressure sores. RESULTS: The results of the studies 
analysed led the authors to the conclusion that massage as therapy for preventing pressure sores 
in patients at risk is not recommended.

LINDE and colleagues, Munchener Modell, Centre for Complementary Medicine Research, 
Technische Universitat/Ludwig-Maximillans-Universitat, Munchen, Germany write that 
homoeopathy appears to be scientifically implausible but is widely used. The authors assessed 
the clinical effect reported in randomised controlled trials of homoeopathic remedies compared to 
placebo. METHODS: The literature search included studies from computerised bibliographies, 
contracts with researchers, institutions, manufacturers, individual collectors, conference 
proceedings and books in all languages, double blind and/or randomised placebo-controlled 
trials. From 185 trials identified, 119 met the inclusion criteria and 89 had data adequate for meta-
analysis. Study quality was assessed by two reviewers with two scales and extracted data for 
clinical outcome, homoeopathy type, dilution, “remedy” population and outcomes. RESULTS: The 
combined odds ratio for the 89 studies entered into the main meta-analysis was 2.45 in favour of 
homoeopathy. The odds ratio for the 26 good quality studies was 1.66 and, following correction 
for publication bias was 1.78. 4 studies regarding the effects of a single remedy upon seasonal 
allergies had a pooled odds ratio for eye symptoms at 4 weeks of 2.03. CONCLUSIONS and 
DISCUSSION: The results from this meta-analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that 
clinical effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo. [Editor’s note: How is that for a 
negative way of phrasing essentially a positive result?] However there was insufficient evidence 
to show that homoeopathy was clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. Further 
research regarding homoeopathy is justified provided that it is rigorously and systematically 
conducted.

WHITE, RESCH and ERNST, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical 
School, University of Exeter UK write that information regarding GPs’ use of and attitudes toward 
Complementary Medicine (CM) is necessary in order to progress the debate about the role of CM 
within mainstream medicine. Evidence shows that the use of CM is particularly high in the South-
West of the UK. METHODS: A survey of all primary care physicians working in the health service 
in Devon and Cornwall was carried out via a questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 981 GPs contacted, 
461, or 47% replied to the questionnaire. 316 GPs (68%) had been involved with CM in some 
way during the previous week. At least one form of CM was practised by 74 (16%) of the 
respondents, the two most common being homoeopathy (5.9%) and acupuncture (4.3%). 115 
(25%) had referred at least one patient to a complementary therapist in the previous week and 
253 (55%) had endorsed or recommended CM treatment. The three most effective therapies 
rated by the GPs were chiropractic, acupuncture and osteopathy and a majority of the 
respondents thought that these three therapies ought to be funded by the health service. 176 
(38%) of respondents reported adverse effects, the most common following manipulation. 
 CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds of GPs in Devon and Cornwall, higher than the national 
average, who replied to this questionnaire had been involved with complementary medicine in 
some way during the previous week. The majority of GP respondents thought that acupuncture, 
chiropractic and osteopathy were effective therapies and should be funded by the NHS. 
White AR, Resch KL and Ernst E. Complementary medicine: use and attitudes among GPs. Fam 
Pract 14(4): 302-6. Aug 1997. 
 
COMMENTS: Without wishing to dampen down these extremely promising figures of GPs 
embracing complementary medicine, it must be pedantically pointed out that merely 47% of the 
GPs contacted replied to the questionnaire. If the percentage of use of complementary therapies 
by GPs is the same for the remaining 53% of GPs who didn’t respond, then we have the glowing 
situation whereby two thirds of GPs support at least the more mainstream therapies of 
complementary medicine. However, if the worst case scenario exists whereby none of these 520 
other GPs endorse or use complementary medicine, then the percentage drops to 316 out of 981, 
or roughly one third. Probably the real figure is somewhere between one and two thirds, or one 
half, which is still a milestone achievement. 
 
ALKHAWAJAH, Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, King Faisal University, 
Dammam, Saudi Arabia writes that Juglans regia L. bark is used as a toothbrush and a cosmetic 
lip colourant dye in some countries. RESULTS: This bark extract showed a broad spectrum 
antimicrobial activity in a dose-dependent manner, inhibiting the growth of several pathogenic 
micro-organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, gram-positive 
bacteria, and Esherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-negative bacteria and the 
yeast Candida albicans. The bark extract had either synergistic or additive anti-microbial action 
when used with a wide range of antibacterial drugs. Its action also increased saliva pH. 
CONCLUSIONS: Brushing the teeth with this bark may help to improve oral hygiene, prevent 
plaque, cavity formation and reduce gingival and periodontal infections. 
Alkhawajah AM. studies on the antimicrobial activity of juglans regia. Am J Chin Med 25(2): 175-
80. 1997. 
 
COMMENTS: As the above two studies illustrate, there is a significant research effort 
internationally devoted to detecting antimicrobial and antifungal activity among herbal and plant 
materials. In view of the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance to the widespread use of 
antibiotics, this type of research and these results will gain in importance as time progresses. 
 
HOU and LI, Xinjiang Academy of Forestry Science, China have previously shown that plants 
exhibit functional characteristics similar to the meridian system in humans and animals, including 
high potential and low electrical resistance, high temperature and spontaneous sound production. 
In this paper the authors show the effect of acupuncture on plants. METHODS: 2 cultivars of 
Phaseolus vulgaris (pole bean and bush bean) were subjected to acupuncture by the insertion of 
2 needles into opposite sides of the stem of the unifoliolate buds. RESULTS: Acupuncture 
strengthened the growth and development of the plants. Two repeated experiments 
demonstrated that, compared to the control plants under the same growing conditions, the mean 
net photosynthesis rate of the acupuncture-treated plants increased by about 20.5%, mean 
transpiration by 27.2%, growth, total internodal length by 22.5%, and total dry weight of shoots 
from the cotyledon to the apex by 22.9%. Additionally acupuncture-treated plants flowered 3 days 
earlier and produced 14.4% more fruit than untreated control plants. CONCLUSIONS: 
Acupuncture may become a viable technique for increasing agricultural yield of crop plants.

COMMENTS: What astonishing research results, which, in addition to adding to the evidence of 
the existence of acupuncture meridians, also shows that acupuncture increases agricultural 
productivity in food crops such as beans!

MILLAR, Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa. millway@statcan.ca. studied the 
use of alternative health care practitioners by Canadians aged 15 and over. METHODS: Data 
from 17,626 respondents from the 1994-95 National Population Health Survey were selected. 
Consultation with an alternative health care practitioner or chiropractor was considered to be an 
indicator of use of alternative health care. RESULTS: In 1994-95, some 15% of Canadians aged 
15 and above (3.3 million people) used some form of alternative health care in the year preceding 
the survey. The most prevalent users of alternative health care were women, people aged 45-64 
and among higher income groups. Use of alternative health care was associated with the number 
of diagnosed chronic illnesses. In people free of chronic diseases, 9% visited alternative 
practitioners, compared with 26% who had three or more chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: 
The projected demand for services from alternative practitioners will rise as the population ages 
and the proportion of people with multiple chronic illness increases. Inclusion of alternative 
practitioner services under existing health care plans could result in higher health care costs. 
Millar WJ. Use of alternative health care practitioners by Canadians. Can J Public Health 88(3): 
154-8. May-Jun 1997. 
COMMENTS: The whole idea of much of alternative and complementary therapies is that these 
therapies, by and large, are much less expensive than many high-tech treatments and may also 
help to actually treat chronic illnesses which are refractive to conventional medical approaches. 
For example, treatment of arthritis or back pain with dietary measures or bodywork procedures 
costs less than expensive cortisone or gold injections or surgery and also less likely to cause 
serious side effects, if at all. Perhaps these researchers ought to think again at their conclusions 
above! 
MAA and colleagues, School of Nursing, Chang Gung College of Medicine and Technology, 
Taiwan, Republic of China write that acupressure, a therapy in which gentle pressure is applied 
with fingers at specific acupoints on the body, has been reported to relieve pain and to have other 
therapeutic effects. The authors investigated the value of self-administered acupressure as an 
adjunct to a pulmonary rehabilitation programme (PRP) for the relief of dyspnea and other 
symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: 31 new 
patients beginning a 12-week PRP were randomly assigned to one of two groups in a single-blind 
pretest-posttest cross-over study. Group 1 patients were taught acupressure and practised 
acupressure daily at home for 6 weeks, then used sham acupressure for the following 6 weeks. In 
group 2, the order of acupressure and sham acupressure was reversed. Throughout weeks 1, 6 
and 12, patient dyspnea, symptoms associated with COPD, activity tolerance, lung function and 
functional exercise capacity were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with sham acupressure, real 
acupressure was more effective in reducing dyspnea and was minimally effective for the relief of 
decathexis. Sham acupressure appeared to be more effective for reducing peripheral sensory 
symptoms, but the presence of these symptoms may also be an indication that the acupressure is 
affecting the body. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure appears to be useful to patients with COPD as 
an adjunct to a PRP in reducing dyspnea. People not familiar with traditional Chinese medicine 
can learn and will accept self-administered acupressure as part of their self-care.

SUDAN reports that extremely low frequencies ranging from 1-1.Hz, imprinted in water (imprinting 
was performed by succussing a glass containing the water) resulted in the total abrogation 
(disappearance) of a facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. This has been proposed as a visible model for 
the theory of "memory of water". This technique provides a new perspective regarding the enigma 
of homoeopathy and the treatment of allergic diseases and possibly other inflammatory reactions.

FRYBACK and REINERT, Indiana University, USA write that people coping with AIDS and cancer 
have a sense of being out of control in dealing with their illness. Much of this feeling stems from 
the uncertainty regarding the accepted medical treatment for their disease. METHODS: The 
authors conducted a research study to evaluate attitudes towards dealing with AIDS and cancer. 
RESULTS: Respondents in the naturalistic research study were adamant in their belief that 
alternative therapies assisted to regain control over their care and therefore, enhanced their 
health. It is critically important that clinical nurse specialists who often act as consultants to other 
nurses, understand and support the therapeutic choices of their patients. Additionally, in light of 
the evidence supporting the benefit of stress reduction upon length of survival, advanced practice 
nurses can play a major role in helping patients to reduce stress and enhance quality of life and 
hopefully longevity.

CASTOT and colleagues, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance Hopital Fernand Widal, Paris, 
France write that for several years, herbal medicines have been consumed increasingly by 
patients without prescription. Traditionally herbal medicines are innocuous; however as medicinal 
products they require drug surveillance in order to identify any risks. A primary concern is to 
confer upon them legal status, in order to evaluate their efficacy and control their safety. 
Published research indicates that the risk is usually due either to a contaminant, an added drug or 
falsification. The Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres have received, since 1985, 341 reports of 
undesirable effects attributed to herbal medicines. Included were 30 cases of hepatitis associated 
with germander which has now been withdrawn from the French market. This illustrates the role 
for the national system and its responsibility for collecting and evaluating adverse drug reactions 
due to herbal medicines.

Therefore, the author attempted to assess massage on grounds of results to mechanisms of 
action, indications and contraindications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite certain reservations, this 
successful method, namely massage, should keep its place by using calculated prescription 
within complex treatment programmes.

ERNST and WHITE, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, 
University of Exeter UK write that although laboratory studies demonstrate that acupuncture may 
produce physiological effects, clinical studies of acupuncture are often inconclusive. The authors 
assert that randomised controlled trials are the best way to test for the specific therapeutic 
effectiveness of a particular treatment modality. Difficulties in clinical acupuncture research 
include: diversity of forms of therapy; individualised treatments; binding; choosing a credible 
control procedure; selection of suitable endpoints; and traditional diagnosis. Furthermore, 
enthusiasm of acupuncture proponents may bias the research they are performing. 
CONCLUSIONS: The authors state that none of these difficulties is insurmountable. They list 
examples of rigorous trials and offer suggestions in order to improve acupuncture research.

COMMENTS: As Complementary therapies become more widespread and accepted as effective 
and safe means of treatment, so will each therapy – massage, acupuncture, herbal medicine – 
become subjected to a greater degree to rigorous and critical evaluation. These evaluations and 
examinations will, in the end, greatly benefit the safe and effective practice of these therapies 
which will ultimately help patients treated.

SCHENK and colleagues, Department of Family medicine, Wayne State University School of 
Medicine, Detroit, Michigan USA write that although The Institute of Medicine has recommended 
basic clinical competence in Environmental Medicine (EM) for all physicians, the amount and 
content of such instruction in EM currently offered in US medical schools in unknown. 
METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study based upon responses to a 
questionnaire, mailed in June 1994 concerning the EM curriculum content in US medical schools, 
in Association of American Medical colleges curriculum survey. RESULTS: 119 out of 126 
schools (94%) responded. Of these 29 (24%) reported no required EM curriculum content. Those 
schools with EM content averaged 7 hours of instruction. 81 schools (68%) had faculty with 
environmental and occupational medicine expertise, primarily within departments of medicine, 
preventive, and family medicine. CONCLUSIONS: In order for medical students to acquire the 
knowledge and skills to prevent, diagnose and treat health problems with an environmental 
exposure component, there is a need for increased EM instruction within medical school 
curricula. In those schools with EM content in their curriculum, the required expertise to develop 
EM curriculum may be available within existing faculty.

COMMENTS: I sincerely hope that the Institute of Medicine also decrees in the very near future 
that physicians ought to acquire clinical competence in Nutritional Medicine, a vitally important 
subject which is similarly not provided for in medical school curricula in the USA nor in the UK. 
XU and colleagues, Office of Research, Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Athens 
45701 USA studied the differences between osteopathic and allopathic physicians regarding 
factors which influenced their career choice of family practice. METHODS: Surveyed were 256 
osteopathic and 717 allopathic family physicians, who had graduated in 1983 and 1984. 
Comparisons were made on 19 variables which influenced physicians’ decision to enter family 
practice and on the six factor scores derived these 19 variables. RESULTS: Osteopathic 
physicians’ decisions to choose family practice was more influenced by financial obligations, 
medical school experiences and family values, whereas allopathic physicians were more 
influenced by personal social value. Overall, medical school experience and personal social value 
were the two important factors explaining the largest variances of the 19 predictors influencing 
physicians’ decisions to enter family practice. Allopathic medical schools whose mission 
emphasises production of generalist physicians may be able to model approaches already in 
place in osteopathic medical schools. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the large influence of the 
personal social value factor in medical students’ choice to enter family practice medicine, this 
factor warrants further study.

DOXEY and PHILLIPS, Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, Whittier, California 90609-1166 
USA compared US chiropractic college admissions requirements with those of allopathic, 
osteopathic, optometry, podiatry and dentistry. METHODS: Participants in the survey included 16 
chiropractic, 17 allopathic, 16 osteopathic, 16 optometric, 7 podiatric and 15 dental colleges. Data 
collected from the individual schools included: 1) minimum number of undergraduate semester 
hours toward a bachelor’s degree required on entrance; 2) actual percentage of applicants with a 
4-year bachelor’s degree on entrance; 3) minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) required on 
 entrance; and 4) actual average GPA of applicants on entrance. RESULTS: Overall, allopathic 
averages were highest and chiropractic averages lowest for each of the four outcome measures, 
with the other disciplines scoring varying points in between. CONCLUSIONS: The successful 
completion of preprofessional requirements may provide an indicator for success within a 
rigorous professional curriculum. These results reflect overall differences between health-care 
professions based upon several entrance criteria. Further study is required to understand the 
long-term consequences of these differences, as well as any economic and/or political factors 
which may be contributing to these data. 
Doxey TT and Phillips RB. Comparison of entrance requirements for health care professions. J 
Manipulative Physiol Ther 20(2): 86-91. Feb 1997. 
COMMENTS: Stripped of any interpretation, these results starkly show that among the 5 
professions surveyed – allopathic medicine, osteopathy, optometry, podiatry, dentistry, and 
chiropractic – those students with the highest education and highest grades chose to enter 
allopathic medical schools and those with the least education and lowest grades (among the 5 
types of colleges) chose chiropractic college. Not having seen the actual data, but only the 
abstract, we are not informed of the degree of difference separating these professions, nor of the 
order between highest to lowest. This information is of course absolutely necessary prior to 
making any further comments; however, common sense alone would advise that factors such as 
prestige, income potential and professional advancement within the USA would certainly be major 
factors in the motivation of the finest students to become allopathic physicians.

LAWSON and CALDERON, Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Rehabilitation Services, 
Touro College, Dix Hills, NY 11746, USA conducted two trials testing the inter examiner reliability 
of Applied Kinesiology manual testing. METHODS: In the first trial, 3 practitioners, each with more 
then 10 years' experience using muscle testing, tested 32 healthy people in order to compare 
their agreement regarding the strength or weakness of right and left piriformis and right and left 
hamstring muscles. The second study had the same 3 examiners test 53 individuals for strength 
or weakness of pectoralis and tensor fascia lata muscles bilaterally. RESULTS: In the first trial, 
although there was significant agreement between examiners for piriformis muscles, little 
agreement was found with the hamstring muscles. In the second trial, significant agreement 
occurred with pectoralis muscles, but not with the tensor fascia lata muscles.

testing. Percept Mot Skills 84(2): 539-46. Apr 1997. 
COMMENTS: Reproducibility and reliability in muscle testing has always been a subject of 
vigorous debate and this issue needs to be resolved urgently, in light of the large number of 
practitioners who use muscle testing as a diagnostic tool.  
PARAMORE, Project Hope Center for Health Affairs, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA conducted 
a study to update national estimates regarding the use of alternative therapies, in order to 
improve the quality of the estimates and to investigate differences between users and nonusers 
of alternative medicine. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 1994 Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation National Access to Care Survey. RESULTS: Almost 10% of the US population, about 
25 million people, visited a professional in 1994 for at least one of the following four therapies: 
chiropractic, relaxation techniques, therapeutic massage or acupuncture. Alternative therapy 
users made almost twice as many visits to conventional practitioners compared to nonusers, 
users still reported much higher levels of unmet need for medical care. CONCLUSIONS: The 
growing emphasis upon market-driven health care and consumer choice suggests that alternative 
therapies may have a larger role in the health-care system for the future.

SOLLNER and colleagues, Department of Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Leopold 
Franzens University, Innsbruck Austria. wolfgang.soellner@uibk.ac.at. studied melanoma 
patients' attitude toward alternative therapies, compliance with conventional treatment, social 
 support received and their coping strategies with their illness. METHODS: Out of 236 consecutive 
patients in a University hospital melanoma clinic serving the Tyrol region, 215 participated in the 
study. Patients completed questionnaires regarding their interest in alternative therapies, their 
distress and social support and coping skills. RESULTS: 117 patients (54.4%) expressed an 
interest in nonconventional therapy and 30 patients (14%) actually used such methods, those 
patients more often suffering from advanced cancer. Compared with the disinterested patients, 
those patients interested in alternative therapy were younger, showed a more active coping style 
and tendencies toward religiousness and search for personal meaning in their disease. These 
patients' confidence in conventional medicine and compliance with suggestions from their 
physicians were not less than of the uninterested patients, but they believed that they received 
less emotional support from their physicians and expressed interest in receiving much more 
support. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma patients consider non-conventional therapies to be 
supplementary to conventional medical treatment and as a strategy of avoiding passivity and 
coping with feelings of hopelessness. This does not diminish the need to educate patients 
regarding the lack of efficacy of unorthodox methods but stresses the importance of offering them 
adequate emotional support.

need for emotional support in patients with melanoma. Arch Dermatol 133(3): 316-21. March

COMMENTS: Excuse me Messrs Sollner et al, but how is it that you already know that 
unorthodox medical methods lack efficacy in the treatment of melanoma and hence you feel 
obliged to educate your patients of such a fact? How successful are conventional medical 
treatments, and were not the conventional medical treatments of today the unconventional or 
radical experimental treatments of yesterday or last year? There is a considerable published 
medical literature regarding inhibitory and preventive effects of a number of nutrients upon 
melanoma, including Vitamins A, C and E, beta-carotene, selenium and omega-3 and -6 fatty 
acids. These results will eventually lead to "conventional" treatments with these dietary 
supplements.

RAMPES and colleagues, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital NHS Trust, London UK 
surveyed deans of British medical school to assess provision for complementary medicine in the 
curriculum for undergraduate medical students. The authors also questioned medical students at 
one medical school regarding their knowledge of and views on instruction in complementary 
medicine. RESULTS: Although there is little education in complementary medicine at British 
medical schools, this is an area of active curriculum development. Levels of knowledge vary 
widely between different therapies. The majority of medical students want to learn about 
acupuncture, hypnosis, homoeopathy and osteopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary 
medicine instruction ought to be included in the medical undergraduate curriculum. This could be 
achieved without a great increase in the teaching of facts, which could serve as a vehicle to 
introduce broader issues, as recommended by the General Medical Council.

KAINZ and colleagues, Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria write that despite 
the wide practical application of homoeopathy, scientifically credible placebo-controlled studies 
are scarce. The authors evaluated the efficacy of homoeopathy for the treatment of warts on 
children in a prospective, double-blind randomised trial. METHODS: Participating were 60 
children aged 6-12 years with common warts on the back of the hands, who were treated either 
with an individually selected homoeopathic preparation (n=30) of at least a 1:1, 012 dilution or 
given a pure placebo in the form of saccharose (n=30) under double-blind conditions. The area 
occupied by the warts was measured prior to and following 8 weeks of treatment. Reduction of 
the wart area by at least 50% was considered to constitute a response. RESULTS: A total of 16 
children responded - 9 of 30 children in the homoeopathy group and 7 of 30 children in the 
 placebo group. A total cure of warts occurred in 5 children in the homoeopathy group and in 1 
child in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent difference between 
homoeopathic and placebo treatment in children with common warts in this study.

ELDER and colleagues, Department of Family Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, 
Portland USA eldern@OHSU.edu write that in recent years, the use of alternative medicine has 
become more acknowledged in the United States. Many different therapeutic practices are 
encompassed by the terms alternative, unorthodox and complementary medicine and their use by 
the population is now being defined. Also, the number of established family practice patients 
using alternative medicine is not known. METHODS: The authors conducted a survey of patients 
from 4 family practices from a large community in the western United States regarding their use 
of alternative medicine. Participants attended a focus group to discuss more fully their use of 
alternative medicine. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 113 family practice patients, 
of whom fifty percent (57/113) had or were using some form of alternative medicine. However, 
only 53% (30/57) had told their family physician about using alternative medicine. There were no 
significant attributions to gender, educational level, age, race or clinic attended. The main reason 
for using alternative medicine was the belief that it would work. Many patients who worked in 
combination with a family physician mentioned acceptance and control, but those patients who 
did not work with their physician mentioned traditional medicine's limitations and narrow-
mindedness. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians need to be aware that many of their patients 
may be using alternative health care. Open and nonjudgmental questioning of patients may help 
to increase physician knowledge of this use, which may lead to improved patient care and the 
working together of physicians and patients.

PRACTICE AND POLICY GUIDELINES PANEL, National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative 
Medicine (NIHOAM) estimate that 1 out of every 3 Americans uses some form of complementary 
and alternative medicine (CAM) such as acupuncture, homoeopathy and herbal medicine. The 
NIHOAM convened in 1995 an expert panel to examine the role of clinical practice guidelines in 
CAM. RESULTS: The panel concluded that CAM practices are currently unsuitable for the 
development of evidence-based practice guidelines, partly due to lack of relevant outcomes data 
from well-designed clinical trials. Moreover there are challenging methodological problems when 
notions of standardisation and appropriateness are applied to CAM, which uses many different 
treatment practices and encourages highly individualised care. CAM disciplines have 
fundamental differences, which are even more striking when compared with those used by 
Western medicine, in how target conditions are defined, causes of disease, interventions and 
outcome measures of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The panel made a series of 
recommendations regarding strategies to strengthen the evidence base for future guideline 
development in CAM and to better meet the current information needs of clinicians, patients and 
guideline developers seeking information regarding CAM treatments.

CROCETTI and colleagues, UO Epidemiologia, CSPO USL 10, Firenze, Italy write that 
complementary medicine (CM) is widely used by cancer patients. The authors conducted a study 
to evaluate the knowledge of and the attitude towards CM amongst Italian allopathic oncologists. 
METHODS: 76 oncologists from Genoa, 80 oncologists from Naples and 100 hospital 
practitioners from the Province of Sondrio replied to a self-administered structured questionnaire 
regarding CM, including their knowledge and opinion of CM and CM therapists, their sources of 
information, use of CM for themselves, practice of CM and attitude to refer patients to CM. 
RESULTS: 190 oncologists replied; the response from Naples oncologists was significantly lower. 
Twenty percent of the physicians replied that they had no knowledge of CM. Main sources of 
information were newspapers and TV. Twenty-five percent of physicians had personally used CM 
and about twenty-five percent had practised a kind of CM. the percentage of oncologists from 
Genoa who referred their cancer patients to CM was significantly higher than from the other 
 groups. The physicians thought that about 84% of their patients used CM. Oncologists from 
Genoa referred patients to CM at a significantly higher rate. Oncologists who had personally used 
CM referred patients to CM 3 times more frequently than others. CONCLUSIONS: According to 
their physicians, a large percentage of cancer patients used CM. The oncologists' level and 
quality of knowledge of CM was low. Oncologists could hardly be helpful for their patients in 
dealing with therapies different from conventional medicine. 
Crocetti E et al. Complementary medicine and oncologists' attitudes: a survey in Italy. Tumori 
82(6): 539-42. Nov-Dec 1996. 
COMMENTS: It is obvious that the use of complementary medicine among the public has 
burgeoned. The reaction from the medical profession seems to fall into several categories: 1) 
Find out why people want to use complementary medicine and make certain that people tell their 
physicians that they are using complementary medicine; 2) Learn about complementary therapies 
from the newspapers and TV; 3) Actually study and practise complementary therapies; 4) Refer 
patients to complementary practitioners. It is appalling that a fifth of the Italian oncologists 
surveyed above had absolutely no knowledge of complementary medicine, despite their estimate 
that about 85% of cancer patients use these therapies. The preferred answer must lie in the 
setting of standards for complementary therapies, and the gradual introduction of these 
disciplines into the medical school curriculum, so that future generations of physicians are not 
ignorant of complementary medicine.

MELCHART and colleagues, Projekt Munchener Modell, Technische Universitat, Munich, 
Germany write that a scientific evaluation of complementary medical practices being used in 
healthcare is urgently required. They state that although randomised clinical trials are the primary 
tools used for such evaluation, they need not be the only tool. The authors propose that 
systematic clinical auditing could: 1) provide information regarding the “epidemiology” of 
complementary medical practices; 2) make more clearly intelligible the processes used in the 
daily practice of complementary methods; and 3) provide a preliminary estimation of outcomes. 
Systematic clinical auditing uses mainly observational studies of large cohorts of patients. 
METHODS: The authors conducted a pilot study to study the feasibility of using a systematic 
clinical audit for traditional Chinese medicine. 1597 patients admitted to the hospistal between 
February 1 1992 and August 31 1993 were included in the study. The patients’ characteristics, 
diagnoses and preventive and therapeutic treatments were recorded and patients rated the 
intensity of their main complaints upon admission, at discharge and at 2, 6 and 12 months after 
admission. About two thirds of the patients had chronic pain complaints, the most common 
diagnosis being migraine (n=224). Most patients received acupuncture and Chinese herbal 
therapy, 61% received tuina massage and 16% received qigong. The mean intensity of main 
complaints was 7.0 upon admission, 4.6 at discharge and 5.5, 12 months after admission. 
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic clinical auditing is a valuable tool for collecting basic information 
regarding structural characteristics, processes, and outcomes regarding complementary medicine 
and for the determination of representative and relevant questions for future randomised clinical 
trials.

DIMMOCK and colleagues, Clinical Pharmacology Unit (Rheumatism Research) Unversity of 
Leeds, United Kingdom examined the factors influencing the use of complementary therapies in 
patients suffering with fibromyalgia. METHODS: 90 patients who had attended a rheumatology 
out-patients clinic in West Yorkshire for their diagnosis or treatment of fibromyalgia were sent a 
postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 71% of patients with fibromyalgia had used or were using 
complementary therapies, the most popular therapy being oral supplementation. Those using 
complementary therapies were from a higher socio-economic group. The duration of treatment 
with complementary therapies ranged from 3 months to 26 years (median = 3) and the number of 
therapies used by each patient ranged from 1 to 10. There was an association between the 
 duration of fibromyalia and the duration of complementary therapies and the number of therapies 
used. The most frequent source of advice (40%) for the decision to use complementary therapies 
was from a magazine. Patients using complementary therapies were less likely to be satisfied 
with their current hospital treatment and decided to try complementary therapy in order to gain 
relief from the symptoms of their fibromyalgia. The authors surmised that the relatively high cost 
and lack of information regarding complementary therapies apparently dissuaded those patients 
(29%) who did not use them.  
Dimmock S et al. Factors predisposing to the resort of complementary therapies in patients with 
fibromyalgia. Clin Rheumatol. 15(5): 478-82. Sep 1996.  
COMMENTS: It is fairly obvious from the language used in the title and throughout the article that 
these researchers frown on people trying to get help by using alternative methods rather than the 
conventional ones that don’t seem to help. Would they prefer that fibromyalgia sufferers just 
accept the fact that they have fibromyalgia, that nothing can help them and they should suffer 
silently for the duration? Do the authors consider bodywork therapies such as osteopathy, soft 
tissue and neuromuscular techniques alternative therapies, since these therapies are frequently 
used in the treatment of this most distressing condition?  
BENDELOW and WILLIAMS, Department of Applied Social Studies, University of Warwick, 
Coventry UK write that studies regarding the lay evaluation of pain-relief clinics are rare, 
particularly in the UK. The authors conducted a small-scale qualitative study which followed the 
vicissitudes of hope and despair of pain-relief attendees in London. The study demonstrates the 
complex interplay between peoples’ pain careers, their styles of adjustment, socio-demographic 
characteristics, and their evaluations of medical treatment. Unfortunately for many patients, this 
was the end of the road, their last hope of finding relief. However, the overriding feeling was of 
medicine having failed these people. The paper discusses these findings and includes discussion 
for possible future research.

SEERS, Royal College of Nursing Institute, Radclife Infirmary, Oxford UK reports the results of a 
study which investigated the experiences of 75 people with chronic non-malignant pain. The 
author writes that people with chronic non-malignant pain may find that traditional medical 
techniques do not alleviate their pain and may have to learn to live with the pain which can affect 
their lives in many ways. The study collected qualitative data illustrating what it meant to people 
to experience this chronic pain. It was shown that pain adversely affected many dimensions of 
sufferers’ lives, which effects extended to family and friends. Having others believe that the pain 
was real was crucial to many patients. Health care professionals can offer these patients a great 
deal to help them come to terms with the way in which pain has affected both themselves and 
others in their lives.

COMMENTS: I wholeheartedly recommend to any pain sufferer the excellent book Full 
Catastrophe Living: How to cope with stress, pain and illness using mindfulness meditation by 
Jon Kabat-Zinn (Piatkus Books, 1996 £14.99). This book details the successful strategy 
employed by the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center using 
mindfulness meditation. This book also has about the finest description of meditation and how to 
use it for pain relief that I have yet to read.  
GOOD, Case Western Reserve University, Frances Payne Bolton, School of Nursing, Cleveland 
Ohio USA writes that postoperative patients vary in their response to pain and opioid medication 
and that it is important that nurses can offer other options as adjuvants to medication. Relaxation 
and music may reduce pain by interrupting the postoperative cycle of pain, muscle tension and 
sympathetic activity. The author reviews (51 references), summarises and critiques studies on the 
effectiveness of relaxation and music used during postoperative pain. RESULTS: Relaxation and 
music were effective in reducing affective and observed pain in the majority studies, but were less 
often effective in reducing sensory pain or opioid intake. However, differences between surgical 
procedures, experimental techniques, activities during testing, measurement of pain and amount 
of practice make direct comparisons difficult. Also, the validity of the studies’ conclusions are 
further reduced because of problems of inadequate sample size, lack of random assignment, no 
 assurance of pretest equivalence, delayed post-test administration and no control for opiates at 
the time of testing. Nevertheless, randomised controlled studies of the types of relaxation and 
music most helpful to postoperative patients should be explored.

HENTSCHEL and colleagues, Klinik Blankenstein, Hattingen, Germany write that complementary 
medicine is used to varying extent in industrial nations. They write that there are incomplete data 
regarding the efficacy, safety and costs of such treatment, with little known regarding special 
features and motivation of individuals choosing complementary medicine. The authors conducted 
a study to ascertain any sociodemographic, disease-related, psychological and life-style 
differences between users of complementary and conventional medicine. METHODS: 419 
patients, recruited from specialist internal or general medical practices were divided into 2 groups: 
Group 1 – conventional medicine users: 91 women, 106 men, average age 43.2 years; Group 2 – 
complementary medicine users: 159 women, 63 men, average age 43.2 years. The results from 
the standardised interview and questionnaire with 168 items was statistically analysed. 
RESULTS: Compared to the conventional medicine group, patients treated with complementary 
medicine clearly differed with respect to sociodemographic, disease-related and psychological 
and life-style characteristics. The relationship between patient-doctor differed between the 
groups. Compared to the conventional group, those in the complementary group had a higher 
educational level and lower risk factors for smoking and alcohol use. Patients from both groups 
preferred conventional medicine for serious diseases, such as heart attack, tumour and AIDS. 
CONCLUSIONS: Patients choosing complementary medicine had a healthier life-style. As the 
efficacy risks and costs of complementary medicine have been inadequately investigated, 
research in this area should be intensified.

BOURGEAULT, York Centre for Health Studies, York University, North York, Ontario, Canada 
ivyh@yorku.ca studied the attitudes and reactions of physicians to their patients' use of 
alternative cancer therapies, factors affecting these reactions and physicians' views of how the 
use of these therapies affected the physician-patient relationship. METHODS: Participants were 
18 oncologists and 12 general practitioners (GPs) in Toronto. RESULTS: Many physicians were 
unfamiliar with alternative cancer therapies and indicated that their main information sources 
were their patients and the lay press. Although most of the physicians thought that the efficacy of 
alternative therapies was scientifically unproven, they respected their patients' decision to use 
them and encouraged them to continue with conventional treatment. Factors which influenced 
physicians' reactions included: the prognosis with standard treatment; exclusivity of the use of 
alternative therapies; and whether the alternative therapies were harmful. Although most 
physicians felt that the use of alternative cancer therapies did not affect the physician-patient 
relationship, several indicated that this caused some tension. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of 
information by physicians regarding alternative cancer therapies and their clinical efficacy, 
physicians' attitudes toward their use by patients are influenced more by the efficacy or inefficacy 
of conventional treatment and the invasiveness of the alternative therapy rather than by the 
efficacy of the alternative therapy used. Bourgeault IL. Physicians' attitudes toward patients' use

 WALACH and RIGHETTI, Abteilung Rehabilitationspsychologie, Universitat Freiburg, 
Bundesrepublik Deutschland Germany provide a review (91 references) of homoeopathy. The 
topics covered include: 1) the scientific foundations; 2) problems and importance of research; 3) 
basic and clinical research findings; 4) future strategies of evaluation. RESULTS and 
CONCLUSIONS: Homoeopathy is a medical discipline in its own right and is quite distinct from 
orthodox medicine regarding basic tenets, research paradigms and practical approach to therapy, 
even though both methods are empirically founded and share the goal of healing the sick. 
Difficulties are encountered when homoeopathy is pressed into a framework of research 
paradigm alien to its own approach. Despite these difficulties, some studies with rigorous design 
have demonstrated that homoeopathic remedies are effective. Important research findings are 
discussed and future evaluation strategies are proposed by the authors.

RANKIN-BOX discusses the potential for complementary therapies in Accident and Emergency 
(A&E) departments. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: While a number of therapies may be 
effective in emergency settings, nurses must consider the broader implications regarding their 
use in A&E departments. Complementary therapies will probably be used as therapeutic 
techniques rather than discrete therapeutic entities, due to the organisational context and the 
nature of acute work in A&E departments, an approach not dissimilar to the use of 
complementary therapies in other nursing specialities. While the use of complementary therapies 
as techniques may enhance therapeutic care and be beneficial in the short term, nurses need to 
reflect and reappraise what they are actually doing and the extent to which they can reconcile two 
apparently opposite paradigms of health care. There is considerable potential regarding the use 
of complementary therapy techniques in A&E departments; example of therapies and conditions 
are described.

inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 72 with Crohn's disease and 33 with ulcerative colitis, 
attending a university out-patient clinic. Patients using unconventional therapies were compared 
with those who did not in respect to: disease-related data, sociodemographic variables, patients' 
disease-related concerns and their perceived level of information regarding IBD. Concerns were 
measured with Rating Form of IBD Patient Concerns (RFIPC), activity of inflammatory disease 
was assessed by physicians using the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and the clinical 
activity index (CAI). RESULTS: Of the 97 patients (92.4%) who replied to all the questions, 33 
(34%) used unconventional therapies in addition to conventional therapy. There was no 
difference between the groups with respect to level of knowledge regarding IBD and 
sociodemographic data. There was a significant difference in that the longer the disease duration, 
the more often patients used unconventional therapies. The most important differences between 
users and nonusers were: patients using unconventional therapies were more concerned about 
surgery, being treated as different and feeling out of control. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a 
relationship between the use of unconventional therapies and certain disease-related concerns, 
which should be addressed in clinical practice and which may help patients avoid using unproven 
and expensive alternative therapies. 
Moser G et al. Relationship between the use of unconventional therapies and disease-related 
concerns: a study of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. J Psychosom Res 40(5): 503-9. 
May 1996. 
COMMENTS: It is indeed touching that these physicians are so concerned to save IBD patients 
money for alternative therapies. It is not surprising that the longer patients had IBD, the more they 
tried other therapies and that they were more concerned about the effects of surgery and their 
disease taking control of their lives.

BEGBIE and colleagues, Department of Clinical Oncology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, 
NSW, Australia assessed and compared the use of alternative versus conventional medicine by 
cancer patients in a public hospital oncology unit. METHODS: Out of 507 patients who attended 
the Royal North Shore Hospital and Port Macquarie Base Oncology Outpatient Clinic, 335 (66%) 
completed a questionnaire survey, of which 319 (62%) were adequate for analysis. The main 
outcome measures were expectations of and satisfaction with conventional and alternative 
treatment and patient characteristics associated with this use. RESULTS: Expectations and 
satisfaction with both conventional and alternative treatment were very high. Alternative 
treatments - dietary and psychological methods being the most common - were used by 21.9% of 
patients. The Median annual cost for alternative treatment was $530 and most patients reported 
"value for money". Young age and being married were positively associated, and satisfaction with 
conventional treatment was negatively associated with alternative medicine use. 40% of patients 
did not discuss alternative medicine with their physician. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion 
of cancer patients use one or more alternative therapies. The authors state that the use of 
alternative therapy may reflect on deficiencies in the current standard of care. 
Begbie SD et al. Patterns of alternative medicine use by cancer patients. Med J Aust 165(10): 
545-8. Nov 18 1996. 
COMMENTS: What a pity that the authors did not conclude that perhaps cancer patients use 
alternative therapies and are satisfied with the results because these therapies are helpful to 
them, rather than their more negative appraisal that people use these therapies because of 
deficiencies in current conventional treatment. 
ERNST, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, University of 
Exeter, UK reviews (22 references) the risks posed by homoeopathy. The author writes that it is 
often assumed that homoeopathy, even though possibly ineffective, is free of risks. This notion is 
questioned in this review, where side-effects and complications associated with homoeopathic 
treatment have been published in the literature. The author further states that the question of 
whether the homoeopath is risk-free in all cases needs discussion. The attitude of certain 
homoeopaths towards immunisation is quoted as an example of particular concern. The author 
states that on the basis of these data the notion of totally risk-free homoeopathy is untenable.

ANDRITZKY, Institut Fur Medizinische Psychologie Der Heinrich Heine Universitat Dusseldorf, 
Germany investigated the spectrum of therapeutic techniques and methods used in clinics with 
psychotherapeutic or psychiatric activities, as well as the spectrum of therapists' qualifications. 
METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 545 clinics and 314 responded. RESULTS: From the 
responding clinics, 127 different methods were named, with an average of 4 each. The larger the 
clinics, the worse the ratio of physicians and psychologists to patients became. In the clinics with 
less than 50 beds, there was 1 psychologist caring for 7 patients; with 51-300 beds, the number 
was one psychologist for 48 patients. the 6 most frequently used methods cited were: music 
therapy (36.9%); imagery (25.2%); dance therapy (23.2%); autogenic training (22.6%); body 
therapies (21.7%); and psychodrama (18.2%). In addition to physicians and psychologists, there 
were 38 other professional groups named. Considering the methods used by particular 
professional groups, an apparent trend towards a professional diversification was noted, eg only 
62% of music therapy was performed by music therapists, the remainder by other professional 
groups. Analysis of special remarks aresulted in 4 groups: discussions regarding the term 
alternative methods; recommendations to use unconventional methods following the clinical 
phase; conceptual changes of a clinic; and broader theoretical backgrounds integrating various 
methods, eg the psychoanalytic concept.

 Massage therapy & Dementia 
 
This detailed research evaluates the use of "Touch-Massage" relating to the abnormal behaviour 
(either in connection with wandering and/or restlessness and/or shouting) of the Elderly who stay 
in a same place and show cognitive deficiency in connection with an Alzheimer's dementia. 
In order to check the "intra personal" consequences this action may have, 4 elderly people were 
chosen and an experimental estimate with different levels was made with them. Two sessions a 
week of 30 minutes each during 6 months (51 sessions) were suggested that is to say a total of 
204 sessions. The effects of this approach regarding the different abnormal behaviour are 
estimated on one hand from a special clinical grid which assess the different reactions, verbal or 
not, which occurred during the session. On the other hand the effects are observed directly fifteen 
minutes after the session. 
The results are explained, first, for each person and compared between each other; then they are 
explained according to a collective way regarding the 4 old people. What emerges from all that is 
that for the whole sessions which were proposed, the activity was accepted at 95%. During the 
session, the signs showing physical relaxation (59%), sleepiness (34%), research of different 
manners to communicate with us (59%), stop or decrease of the abnormal behaviour (79%) prove 
the actual benefit the activity brings during thirty minutes. Fifteen minutes after the session, the 
signs showing physical relaxation (52%), sleepiness (42%), research of different manners to 
communicate with us (23%), stop or decrease of the abnormal behaviour (70%) are always 
significant. In view of the above results, we can stay this new approach using the activity of 
"Touch Massage" brings a further possibility of nursing care and can help to answer the question 
"how to take in charge every day an elderly demented patient".

Abstract: 
There is a growing body of research that connects heart rate and massage. 
These variously associate massage with reduced cardiac rate, lowered 
blood pressure, decreased anxiety and increases in relaxation and a sense 
of well-being. Dunbar and Redick looked specifically at back massage 
following myocardial infarction and Weiss reports a correlation between 
touch and heart rate during tracheal suctioning. This paper describes how 
massage was used to restore cardiac rhythm from a state of atrial 
fibrillation in one patient

Abstract: 
Limb edema, particularly when associated with terminal cancer, has a 
significant effect on a patient's (pt's) quality of life. Starting in 1980, a 
treatment program, based on an American method to reduce limb edema 
in advanced cancer, was developed at Countess Mountbatten House, 
Southampton; modifications and improvements have resulted in the 
current management program which applies to all forms of obstructive 
limb edema found in advanced cancer involving either the lymphatic or 
venous system. The treatment program is designed to take 8 days. It 
comprises an elastic containment garment and proximal massage, followed 
by pneumatic compression for 2-6 hr (in 1- or 2-hr periods), interspersed 
with fluid mobility exercises. The program begins with assessment which 
will indicate the condition of the tissues. In severe edema, congestion of

lymphatic vessels usually extends beyond the limb into the trunk. About 
20 min each day spent massaging the congested area will clear the 
proximal lymphatic channels and allow free drainage from the limb when 
pumping begins. Elastic containment garments are the key to successful 
treatment. They provide external pressure to maintain the reduction in 
limb volume gained during the daily compression treatment. An elastic 
garment is fitted at the start of treatment, and, apart from being removed 
for treatment and bathing, should be kept on continuously. During 
treatment, smaller garments should be fitted as appropriate. On 
completion of the treatment, the garment should be worn indefinitely. 
Garments can be bought ready-made. The purpose of the pneumatic pump 
is to provide intermittent compression and a mechanical form of massage 
to the affected limb, expressing the fluid from the tissues into the lymph 
vessels and capillaries and stimulating the flow through the veins and 
lymph channels. Success of the program depends on using all of its 
elements (with the possible exception of pneumatic compression). 
Currently, the British Lymphology Interest Group, formed in 1985, is 
working on a booklet for pts outlining the general principles of 
management of limb edema. (2 Refs)

Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Despite the popularity of complementary therapies with 
the public, knowledge and use of these therapies among doctors appear 
limited. However, studies show that physicians and medical students are 
positive toward complementary therapies and have a high level of interest 
in learning about them. METHODS: The attitudes of medical students 
toward complementary therapies were examined using a questionnaire 
distributed to 800 first-, third-, and fifth-year medical students at two 
universities in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: The survey revealed that 
whereas Australian medical students were positive toward complementary 
therapies, their self-reported knowledge was low, with 56% having no 
knowledge of the principles of complementary therapies. Attitudes toward 
different therapies were found to vary widely, with students having little 
knowledge of chiropractic and naturopathy, the two therapies most 
commonly used by Australians. Students consistently scored meditation, 
massage, and acupuncture the highest with regard to knowledge, 
perceived usefulness, intended patterns of referral after graduation, and 
desire for education in the undergraduate degree. CONCLUSIONS: When 
the medical course included some tuition on complementary therapies, 
students were more positive toward them. A single lecture on 
complementary therapies was found to have significant impact on medical 
students' views. Medical students have a high level of interest in 
complementary therapies that is not being satisfied by their undergraduate 
curricula. (Abstract by: Author)

Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To review and critique the research on the effect of massage 
therapy and therapeutic touch in children, and to describe clinical 
implications and make suggestions for future study. DATA SOURCES: 
Studies were obtained through online computer searches of CINAHL, 
MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and SocioFile. Key words used were tactile, 
kinesthetic, massage therapy, touch, therapeutic touch, infants, and 
children. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND SYNTHESIS: 
Fourteen massage therapy studies were selected because they met the 
following 3 criteria: investigated massage therapy in children; were 
published in refereed nursing, allied health, or infant and child 
development journals between 1969 and 1999; and were quantitative in 
nature. Studies were divided according to developmental age for analysis: 
neonates, preschool, and older children. Five therapeutic touch studies, 3 
quantitative and 2 qualitative, were selected because they were the only 
empirical reports about the! effect of therapeutic touch in children to date. 
In addition to critiques, the therapeutic touch studies were examined for 
the following 10 characteristics: study purpose/hypotheses, 
background/literature review, sample selection method, study 
design/random assignment, independent variable/length of 
treatment/control and confounders, dependent variables/measurements, 
outcomes, study limitations, and implications for future research. 
CONCLUSIONS: More research exists to support the use of massage 
therapy than therapeutic touch in children. A set of common findings 
across 2 decades of study suggests that massage therapy may be useful in 
the care of infants and children. Because massage therapy and therapeutic 
touch seem to elicit similar parasympathetic effects, therapeutic touch may 
be useful. There is insufficient evidence, however, to recommend its use in 
children without qualifications. [References: 61]

Abstract: 
Although the performance of perineal massage by a woman or her partner 
during the last weeks of pregnancy may help to prevent perineal trauma at 
delivery, the technique has never been evaluated rigorously. This study 
examined the feasibility of a randomized, controlled trial, and more 
specifically assessed the participation rate, the acceptability of the 
intervention, and whether or not an attending physician could remain blind 
to participants' groups. The pilot study was a single-blinded, randomized, 
controlled trial. Nulliparous women, 32 to 34 weeks pregnant, were 
recruited from June 8 to July 31, 1992, at the offices of family physicians 
and obstetricians who practice at the Hopital du Saint-Sacrement in 
Quebec City. Women assigned to the intervention group practiced daily 10-
minute perineal massage and completed a diary, and those in the control 
group had standard care. Women and attending physicians completed a 
questionnaire about the aspect of blindness. Among the 174 women who 
delivered during the study period, 104 (59.8%) were approached by a 
midwife and 46 (26.4%) were randomized. Twenty (91.0%) of the 22 
women in the massage group returned their perineal massage diaries. 
Based on the postpartum questionnaire, 20 women practiced the technique 
at least four times a week for three weeks or longer. No woman in the 
control group practiced massage. The attending physician was aware of 
the woman's group in only three instances (6.7%). Based on the results of 
this pilot study, a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 
perineal massage in preventing perineal trauma at birth appears feasible.

Abstract: 
CONTEXT: Headache is the most frequently reported symptom among 
Danish adults, and studies in various European countries indicate migraine 
headache prevalence rates similar to those in Denmark. OBJECTIVE: An 
exploratory study of reflexological treatment for headache was conducted 
from 1993 to 1994 to examine which patients with headache underwent a 
course of reflexological treatment, why patients sought reflexological 
treatment, what previous experience patients had with medication for 
headache, and what outcomes patients experienced from reflexological 
treatment. DESIGN: Prospective and exploratory study using random 
sampling and the following data collection methods: headache diaries, 
registration schemes for practitioners, questionnaires, and qualitative 
interviews. SETTING: Denmark. PATIENTS: 220 patients with migraine 
and/or tension headache. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated for a 
maximum of 6 months by 78 reflexologists systematically drawn from the 
membership l! ists of 5 alternative therapist associations. MAIN OUTCOME 
MEASURES: A diagnosis of each patient's type of headache at the outset of 
treatment was made by a consulting physician according to the 
International Headache Society Classification (1988). RESULTS: At 3-
month follow-up, 81% of patients reported that they were helped by the 
treatments or were cured of their headache problems. Nineteen percent of

those who had formerly taken drugs to control their headaches were able 
to stop medication support following participation in the study. 
CONCLUSIONS: Reflexological treatment seems to improve patients' 
general well-being, energy level, ability to interpret their own body signals, 
and ability to understand the reasons for headache. However, these 
relationships may be due to other factors in the treatment environment. 
Additional studies are necessary to determine the proximate cause of 
reflexology's therapeutic benefits

Abstract: 
The present study investigated the effect of vibrotactile stimulation on 
relaxation as measured by EMG recording. Forty-eight subjects from three 
age groups were randomly divided into 8 experimental groups: (1) 
simultaneous footrest vibration and back vibration (A1C1); (2) 
simultaneous footrest vibration and back roller (A1C2); (3) simultaneous 
footrest vibration, back vibration and back roller (A1C3); (4) footrest 
vibration alone (A1C4): (5) back vibration alone (A2C1); (6) back roller 
alone (A2C2); (7) simultaneous back vibration and back roller (A2C3); and 
(8) control group (no vibration/stimulation) (A2C4). The three major 
variables studied were footrest vibration (A1 and A2), pre- and post-EMG 
measures (B1 and B2), and back vibration (C1C2C3C4). Results showed 
that footrest vibration had a significant effect on relaxation. Other 
conditions (except the control) produced a decrease in EMG levels, but did 
not reach significance. Pre- and postmeasures by experimental conditions 
were also significantly different. Application of vibration as an aid in 
relaxation is discussed. (Abstract by: Author)

Abstract: 
This study examined the effects of two methods of teaching perineal 
massage on the rates of practice of perineal massage, of episiotomy, and 
of lacerations in primiparas at birth. Couples in 20 randomly selected 
sections of four prenatal class series received routine printed and verbal 
instruction and a 12-minute video demonstration of perineal massage, or 
only the routine printed and verbal instruction. Women reported their 
practice rates in daily diary records, which were mailed to the researcher 
weekly. Hospital records provided delivery data. Of the 83 women, 23 
(28%) practiced perineal massage: 16 (35.6%) in the experimental group, 
7 (18.4%) controls. Even though the rate of practice almost doubled 
among experimental group women, the videotape instruction method was 
statistically nonsignificant. Episiotomy and laceration rates were not 
affected by teaching method. More severe lacerations occurred among the 
experimental group; however, the control group had almost four times as 
many severe (21%) as minor (5.3%) lacerations. The experimental group 
had twice as many severe (28.9%) as minor (13.3%) lacerations. These 
results were also nonsignificant. (Abstract by: Author)

the Qi Gong state, on the Qi-Gong Master's body, as well as the body of 
the patient being treated, acupuncture points CV5 (Shi Men) and CV6 (Qi 
Hai)-- located below the umbilicus-- show changes from +4 in the pre-Qi 
Gong state to between -3 and -4 during the Qi Gong state. Before and 
after the Qi Gong, there is a normal +4 response to the Bi-Digital O-Ring 
Test at these acupuncture points. Similar changes were also observed on 
acupuncture points CV17 (Shan Zhong), CV 22 (Tian Tu), Yin Tang (at an 
area just between the eyebrows: the pituitary gland representation area, 
colloquially known as the 'third eye') and GV20(Bai Hui), the entire 
pericardium meridian & triple burner meridian, their acupuncture points, 
the adrenal glands, testes, ovaries and perineum, as well as along the 
entire spinal vertebrae, particularly on and above the 12th thoracic 
vertebra, medulla oblongata, pons, and the intestinal representation areas 
of the brain located just above and behind the upper ear. Using these 
findings as criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of reaching the Qi Gong 
state, we were able to reproduce during the experimental trials similar 
changes in ourselves and the patient being treated with therapeutic effects 
comparable to those of the Qi Gong Master. Beneficial effects of external 
Qi Gong treatment given by a Qi Gong practitioner 1 to 3 times for 10-20 
seconds each (although most Qi Gong masters take 3-20 minutes per 
treatment) often resulted in improvement of circulation and lowering of 
high blood pressure, as well as relaxation of spastic muscles, relief of pain, 
and enhanced general well-being, all of which resemble acupuncture 
effects. In order to reproduce the same procedure with others, we selected 
4 children ranging between 8 and 11 years of age who had no knowledge 
of Qi Gong or Oriental medicine. One of these four children, the 8 year old, 
was able to consistently reach the same Qi Gong state after less than a 
half day and another child, 11, after less than 2 days. Within a week, the 
other two were sometimes able to reproduce the Qi Gong state but not 
always. Using the Qi Gong state thus obtained, it was found that this type 
of Qi Gong energy is directed to specific directions from the hand and can 
even penetrate wooden or metal doors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

Using the 'Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Imaging Technique', the author has been 
able to accurately localize meridians and acupuncture points that 
correspond to specific internal organs and has found that most general

meridians of specific internal organs of the 12 main internal organs 
described in the literature of ancient Chinese medicine, are more or less 
correct, with the exception of some variations and inaccuracies. Each 
meridian of specific internal organs was found to be connected to the 
organ representation area in the cerebral cortex of specific internal organs. 
The acupuncture point has an area and occupies 3-dimensional space. It 
has a circular or slightly oval boundary with diameter in the range of 3 mm 
to 2.7 cm, although 6-12 mm are the most common diameters in human 
adults, with the exception of the area outside the corners of the nailbeds of 
the fingers and toes. Using the 'Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Molecular 
Identification Method', the author also found that within the boundary of 
most acupuncture points and meridian lines (including Heart, Stomach, 
and Triple Burner) were high concentrations of neurotransmitters and 
hormones, including Acetylcholine, Methionine-Enkephalin, Beta-
Endorphin, ACTH, Secretin, Cholecystokinin, Norepinephrine, Serotonin,

and GABA. On all these meridian lines, in addition to the above 
neurotransmitters and hormones, Dopamine, Dynorphin 1-13, 
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and VIP were found, but the latter do not usually 
exist within the boundary of the acupuncture point with the exception of 
the center midline of the acupuncture point where the meridian line is 
situated. Serotonin, Norepinephrine, and Cholecystokinin appeared in 
either one of the above 2 patterns, depending on the individual. Usually, 
no significant amounts of these neurotransmitters and hormones were 
found at the surrounding area outside of meridian and acupuncture points. 
However, the essential amino acid L-Tryptophan (which is a precursor of 
Serotonin), was usually found outside of the boundary of the acupuncture 
point and the meridian but not within the boundary of the acupuncture 
point and the meridian. Wherever Serotonin appeared, L-Tryptophan 
disappeared significantly and when the Serotonin disappeared, L-
Tryptophan reappeared. In addition to the above common 
neurotransmitters and hormones, the Heart meridian had additional Atrial 
Natriuretic Peptide in both the meridian and its acupuncture points. 
Similarly, the Stomach meridian had additional Gastrin in both the 
meridian and its acupuncture points. Likewise,the Triple Burner meridian 
had additional Testosterone (in the male) and Estrogen (especially Estriol 
and Estradiol in the female. (73 Refs) (Abstract by: Author)

Abstract: 
In the process of evaluating the effects of external Qi Gong on inanimate 
substances by the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, Qi Gong energy was shown to 
have a polarity which the author designated for convenience sake (+) or (-
), where (+) increases the strength of muscles and (-) weakens them. 
Depending upon how external Qi Gong is applied and from which part of 
the body it emanates, the polarity changes. In general, it was found that, 
when (+) polarity is applied to the painful area or spastic muscles or 
arteries in vaso-constriction it often reduced or eliminated the pain, spastic 
muscles or circulatory disturbances. The author succeeded in storing part 
of the Qi Gong energy in inanimate materials, such as papers, metals 
(such as a sheet of aluminum foil), glass, stone, band-aids, clothes, drugs, 
etc. in bi-polar (one end of the same material becomes (+) polarity and 
the other end of the same material becomes (-) polarity) form in one 
material or uni-polar, i.e., the entire material either has pure (+) polarity 
or (-) polarity. Water, EPA, vitamins, antibiotics and other drugs were also 
converted to (+) polarity. When the material has a bi-polar state, it 
becomes possible to eliminate one of the polarities by applying certain 
changing electrical fields. The effect of placing (+) polarity Qi Gong energy 
stored material was compared with direct application of the Qi Gong on 
pain, spastic muscle and spastic vertebral arteries. The therapeutic effects 
of these 2 methods were quite similar for the identical time duration but a 
more predictable effect was often obtained in the former. As our previous 
study indicates that acupuncture, electrical stimulation (1-3 pulses/sec.), 
as well as Qi Gong not only improved the microcirculatory disturbance and 
relaxed spastic muscles and vaso-constrictive arteries but also reduced or 
eliminated the pain and also selectively enhanced drug uptake to the area 
where drugs could not be delivered due to existing circulatory 
disturbances, by placing (+) Qi Gong stored material, such as a sheet of 
paper or aluminum foil, band-aid or clothes. Bi- Digital O-Ring Test 
evaluation indicated that not only did it produce all the beneficial effects of 
Qi Gong but also enhanced the drug uptake selectively in the area where it 
is necessary for the drug to be delivered for effective treatment, and 
reduced lead deposits in tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Abstract: 
Various methods of improving circulation and enhancing drug uptake which 
were used in treating some intractable medical problems caused by 
infections, and two syndromes based on the co-existence of Chlamydia 
trachomatis infection (mixed with either Lyme Borrelia burgdorferi or 
Cytomegalovirus) with increased Uric acid are described. The principal 
author's previous studies have indicated that there are two opposite types 
of Qi Gong energy, positive (+) and negative (-). Positive (+) Qi Gong 
energy has been used clinically to enhance circulation and drug uptake in 
diseased areas where there is a micro-circulatory disturbance and drug 
uptake is markedly diminished. (-) Qi Gong energy has completely the

opposite effect and therefore has not been used although there may be 
some as yet undiscovered application. Since the late 1980's the principal 
author has succeeded in storing (+) Qi Gong energy on a variety of 
substances including small sheets of paper, and recently has been able to 
intensify this energy by concentrating it as it passes through a cone-
shaped, tapered glass or plastic object placed directly on the (+) Qi Gong 
energy stored paper. Application of (+) Qi Gong energy stored paper on 
the cardio-vascular representation area of the medulla oblongata at the 
occipital area of the skull often improved circulation and enhanced drug 
uptake. If the drug-uptake enhancement was still not sufficient for the 
drug to reach therapeutic levels in the diseased organ, direct application of 
(+) Qi Gong from the practitioner's hand often enhanced the drug uptake 
more significantly. However, this direct method often results in the 
practitioner developing intestinal micro-hemorrhage within 24 hours which 
may or may not be noticed as mild intestinal discomfort with soft, slightly 
tarry stool. For intensifying (+) Qi Gong energy one of the most efficient 
shapes is a cone with increased intensification occurring at an optimal 
height. However when the total mass and the total distance from base to 
peak is increased beyond an optimal limit, the power decreases. Clinical 
application of Intensified (+) Qi Gong stored energy was evaluated in this 
preliminary study which indicated that intensified (+) Qi Gong energy 
application on the heart representation area of the middle finger on the 
hands markedly improved circulation in the corresponding organ, and 
increased drug uptake and acetylcholine even more effectively than some 
of the previously used drug enhancement methods (Shiatsu massage of 
the organ representation areas and/or application of (+) Qi Gong energy 
stored paper to the occipital area above the cardiovascular representation 
area of the medulla oblongata).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Abstract: 
21 female patients suffering from chronic tension headache received 10 
sessions of upper body massage consisting of deep tissue techniques in 
addition to softer techniques in the beginning. When found, trigger points 
were carefully and forcefully massaged. The range of cervical movements, 
surface ENMG on mm. frontalis and trapezius, visual analogue scale (VAS)

and Finnish Pain Questionnaire (FPQ), and the incidence of neck pain 
during a two week period before and after the treatment, and at 3 and 6 
months during the follow-up period together with Beck depression 
inventory were taken for evaluation and follow-up. The range of movement 
in all directions increased, and FPQ, VAS and the number of days with neck 
pain decreased significantly. There was a significant change in ENMG on 
the frontalis muscle whereas changes in trapezius remained insignificant. 
Beck inventory showed an improvement after the treatment. This study 
confirmed clinical and physiological effects of massage. (Abstract by:

Abstract: 
Therapeutic touch (TT) is believed to help promote relaxation, reduce pain, 
accelerate the healing process, and alleviate psychosomatic illness. 
Patients who undergo surgery frequently experience stressors such as 
anxiety and pain. Although there have been limited studies on the use of 
TT in the surgical arena, it is a stress- reduction method that should be 
explored further. This article discusses studies that examined the use of TT 
in reducing anxiety and pain. [References: 52]

Abstract: 
Electroacupuncture According to Voll (EAV) was used to monitor the effects 
of qigong practice on therapeutic balancing of subjects. In EAV the 
electrical conductance of the skin above individual acupuncture points is 
measured using low voltage and current. Diagnosis depends on measuring

the relative electrical conductance and its time dependence. An important 
diagnostic criterion of degeneration of an organ is an indicator drop which 
occurs during the measurement when the conductance decreases from an 
apparent maximum value and then levels off. Two series of EAV 
measurements were made before and after healthy subjects practiced 
qigong. Measurements were made at 24 acupuncture points at the ends of 
the meridians of the fingers and toes of a subject and were made by the 
same operator and equipment. The subjects were asked to perform a 
qigong exercise of their choosing. In the first series, four subjects were 
examined by EAV before and after qigong exercise. Qigong exercise 
decreased the average EAV measured values of the four subjects in the 
range of -19 to -31%. Qigong eliminated indicator drops for three subjects 
and reduced the indicator drop by 80% for the fourth subject. In the 
second series, each of seven subjects was examined by EAV three times in 
a blind protocol so that the operator did not know whether a subject had 
practiced qigong before the second or third examination. Qigong exercise 
changed the average EAV measured values in the range of -17 to -35% for 
four subjects and 4 to 15% for three subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

Abstract: 
Nine hundred and forty practitioners of massage, abbreviated progressive 
muscle relaxation (PMR), yoga stretching, breathing, imagery meditation, 
and various combination treatments described their technique experiences 
on an 82-item wordlist. Factor analysis yielded 10 interpretable relaxation 
categories: Joyful Affects and Appraisals (Joyful), Distant, Calm, Aware, 
Prayerful, Accepted, Untroubled, Limp, Silent, and Mystery The relaxation 
response and cognitive/somatic specificity models predict Calm and Limp, 
which account for only 5.5% of the variance of relaxation experience. 
Unlike much of previous relaxation research, we found important technique 
differences. PMR and massage are associated with Distant and Limp; yoga 
stretching, breathing, and meditation with Aware; meditation with 
Prayerful and all techniques except PMR with Joyful. Results are consistent 
with cognitive-behavioral relaxation theory and have implications for 
relaxation theory, treatment, training, assessment, and research. We close 
with a revised model of relaxation that posits three global dimensions; 
tension-relief, passive disengagement, and passive engagement. (Abstract

Abstract: 
A 3-mo trial using wrist acupressure bands to control nausea and vomiting 
in patients (pts) undergoing cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy is described. 
These elasticized bands have a button positioned to apply pressure to the 
P6 Nei-Kuon acupuncture point. Eighteen pts were included in the study. 
Every pt received between one and four cytotoxic chemotherapy courses, 
each course taking 1-4 days every 2-4 wk. Acupressure bands were worn 
by all of the pts during some courses and not worn during others. 
Comparisons were made between the times the pts wore the bands and 
the times when they did not or when the bands were incorrectly 
positioned. When acupressure bands were used correctly, nausea 
remained but, in most cases, it was greatly reduced. Vomiting was reduced 
both in number of times and amount of emesis; some pts did not vomit at 
all. Antiemetic drugs were still needed, but the amount of drugs used was 
greatly reduced. Pts could tolerate oral antiemetics and fluids, and some 
were able to eat. Pts felt more in control of their own care and reported 
less depression and fear of returning for their chemotherapy courses. Use 
of the acupressure bands was cost-effective in terms of reducing the use of 
antiemetic drugs and laundry services, improving the effective use of 
nursing time, and in some cases, permitting earlier discharge because pts 
were less debilitated. The results of this trial suggest that further research 
and a randomized controlled trial are justified. (3 Refs)

Abstract: 
Pain relief mechanisms of needling to the pain-producing muscle, 
application of a static magnetic field or external qigong, and needling to 
the acupuncture point were investigated in an experimentally designed 
pain producing muscle of animals. Single isometric twitch height in situ 
was reduced gradually by 10 Hz tetanic stimulation for one hour of the 
gastrocnemius muscle of guinea pigs. This reduction of twitch height was 
recovered by injection of 0.3-1 ml saline to the artery of this muscle, or of 
injection of a vasodilator, isoproterenol dissolved in 0.1 ml saline. Hence, 
reduction of twitch height could be induced by reduction of circulation in 
the muscle and recovery of it could be induced be recovery of circulation. 
Since it is easily considered that a pain substance might be accumulated in 
a muscle under reduced circulation, and such an accumulated substance 
might be eliminated by recovery of circulation, the reduction of twitch 
height after tetanic stimulation could be estimated as the pain-producing 
muscle and recovery of twitch, as the pain relieving muscle. 1) Needling to 
the pain muscle, 2) application of a static magnetic field or external qigong 
to the muscle, and 3) needling to the acupuncture point recovered the 
reduced twitch height due to tetanic stimulation. Atropine abolished this

effect induced by the above 1, 2 and 3 procedures. Hence, the cholinergic 
vasodilator nerve might be involved in the induction of this effect. A sciatic 
nerve cut did not influence the effect of 1), but abolished the effect of 3). 
Denervation and capsaicin abolished the effect of 1). Substance P and a 
calcitonin gene- related peptide (CGRP) recovered the reduced twitch 
height, and atropine blocked the effect of CGRP, but did not block that of 
substance P. The effect of 2) was equivalent to that of anticholinesterase. 
A rostral lesion of the contralateral anterior hypothalamus did not abolish 
the effect of 3, but a caudal lesion of this region did. Electrical stimulation 
of this region produced an effect similar to that of 3). From these results, 
it was concluded that muscle pain relief by these procedures might be 
induced by recovery of circulation due to the enhanced release of 
acetylcholine as a result of activation of the cholinergic vasodilator nerve 
endings innervated to the muscle artery. However, manners of activation 
of the cholinergic nerve was different in effects of 1), 2) and 3). 1) might 
be induced by axon reflex of the CGRP nerve, 2) might be induced by 
inhibition of cholinesterase and 3) might be induced by a somato-
autonomic reflex. The reflex center of this might be in the anterior 
hypothalamus

Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To perform an integrative research review and meta- analysis 
of therapeutic touch research. DATA SOURCES: Bibliography maintained 
by the Nurse Healers-Professional Associates International; MEDLINE, 
CINAHL, and Psylit databases; dissertations and master's theses. STUDY 
SELECTION: Thirty-eight research articles were included in the analysis. All 
dissertations and research articles were analyzed. DATA EXTRACTION: 
Data on 32 substantive characteristics of the sample, the therapeutic touch 
procedure, and the article/dissertation were extracted following Moody's 
method for an integrative research review. The meta-analysis used studies 
that reported means and standard deviations of the treatment and control 
groups. DATA SYNTHESIS: The research questions were as follows: (1) 
What are the substantive characteristics of the sample, the therapeutic 
touch practice, and the article/dissertation in research studies from 1975 
to 1997? (2) What does the research demonstrate r! egarding the efficacy 
of therapeutic touch as an intervention? (3) Based on the results of the 
review and meta-analysis, what are the gaps, trends, and outcomes of the 
therapeutic touch research studies? CONCLUSIONS: The review 
demonstrated that there are many approaches to therapeutic touch 
research, samples are described incompletely, and the therapeutic touch 
practices vary in the studies. Most of the studies supported hypotheses 
regarding the efficacy of therapeutic touch, though a number had mixed or 
negative results. A meta-analysis was performed on 13 studies. The 
average effect size in these studies was .39, which is described as 
moderate. Gaps, trends, and outcomes were identified and discussed

discusses organ theory, patient examination, diagnosis, the meridian 
network system, and treatment modalities such as acupuncture and 
Chinese herbal medicine, giving a brief overview of the different 
acupuncture and Oriental medical styles practiced in the United States. 
Included also are helpful tables, graphs, and photographs to provide a 
better visual context for Oriental medicine. [References: 28]

Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Newborns placed skin-to-skin with their mothers show an 
inborn sequence of behavior similar to that seen in other mammals. The 
purpose of this study was to make a detailed exploration of hand 
movements and sucking behavior in healthy term newborns who were 
placed skin-to-skin on their mothers' chests, and to study maternal 
oxytocin release in relation to these behaviors. METHODS: Ten vaginally 
delivered infants whose mothers had not been exposed to maternal 
analgesia were video-recorded from birth until the first breastfeeding. 
Video protocols were developed based on observations of the videotapes. 
Each infant's hand, finger, mouth, and tongue movements, positions of the 
hand and body, and sucking behavior were assessed every 30 seconds. 
Maternal blood samples were collected every 15 minutes, and oxytocin 
levels were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. A statistical test for 
establishing the relationship between maternal oxytocin levels and infants' 
hand movements ! or sucking behavior was developed. RESULTS: Infants 
used their hands to explore and stimulate their mother's breast in 
preparation for the first breastfeeding. A coordinated pattern of infant 
hand and sucking movements was also identified. When the infants were

sucking, the massagelike hand movements stopped and started again 
when the infants made a sucking pause. Periods of increased massagelike 
hand movements or sucking of the mother's breast were followed by an 
increase in maternal oxytocin levels (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The 
findings indicate that the newborns use their hands as well as their mouths 
to stimulate maternal oxytocin release after birth, which may have 
significance for uterine contraction, milk ejection, and mother-infant 
interaction

Abstract: 
CONTEXT: Acupuncture at the P6 or Neiguan point to treat nausea and 
vomiting has been practiced in China for many years. More recently, 
acupressure at P6 has been used successfully to decrease the symptoms of 
pregnancy sickness and with mixed results to decrease motion sickness. 
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an Acuband, a commercially available 
acupressure wristband, would relieve the symptoms of motion sickness. 
METHOD: 25 healthy subjects, aged 18 to 22 years, prescreened for 
susceptibility to motion sickness, were tested on 3 separate occasions in a 
rotating optokinetic drum with the following conditions: wearing an 
Acuband on the wrist, wearing an Acuband on the arm, and wearing no 
Acuband. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective symptoms of motion 
sickness and abnormal gastric activity, as recorded via 
electrogastrography, were obtained throughout the procedure. RESULTS: 
Subjects reported significantly fewer symptoms of motion sickness on days 
when wearing the Acuband o! n the wrist or the arm than they did on 
control days (when they wore no Acuband). Subjects also showed less 
abnormal gastric activity on the days when wearing an Acuband than they 
did on control days. CONCLUSION: An Acuband worn on the wrist or 
forearm decreases the symptoms of motion sickness and the gastric 
activity that usually accompanies motion sickness

Abstract: 
CONTEXT: Increasing numbers of health plans in the United States offer 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) benefits despite limited 
information. OBJECTIVE: To determine the utilization rates and costs 
associated with providing CAM services in 2 benefit designs, and to 
determine the satisfaction of patients in both plans. DESIGN: Two health 
plans were identified: a traditional indemnity plan offered through a 
defined preferred provider organization (PPO) of CAM providers and a 
health maintenance organization (HMO). Costs and utilization rates for 
CAM services were compared during a 1-year period of coverage beginning 
November 1, 1996. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1091 patients in both 
plans who used CAM services during the month of May 1997 in Washington 
state. RESULTS: Only 1% of all patients covered for CAM accessed these 
services during the study period. A significantly higher percentage of 
patients in the PPO plan (1.2%) used CAM services compared to the HMO 
pla! n (0.6%) (P < .001). However, the average total cost of annual CAM 
services (plan benefit + user contribution) was similar ($347 in the HMO 
and $376 in the PPO), and the price per member per month was nearly 
identical ($0.20 in the HMO and $0.19 in the PPO). Most users perceived 
these services as helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of CAM services and 
per member per month costs were lower than expected given the high 
interest in CAM services reported in consumer surveys. The high level of 
satisfaction with CAM services and self-reported decrease in the use of 
pain medications suggests the need for prospective studies examining the 
effect of CAM treatments

The hypertensive rat model was made by chronic stress of electric foot-shocks and noises. On such 
hypertensive rats, when anesthetized with urethane and chloralose, the electroacupuncture (EA) to 
bilateral "Zusanii (st.36)" acupoints for 20 min, could result in a depressor (including both systolic and 
diastolic pressure) and bradycardiac response as well as an attenuation in the maximum of left ventricular 
pressure, end diastolic pressure and ±dp/dt In power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability aspect, 
EA could increase all total variance, very low frequency component, low frequency component and the 
ratio of low frequency component and high frequency component. When EA with microinjection of Nω-
Nitro-L-Arginine, a blocker of the formation of nitric oxide, into the ventral periaqueductal gray matter 
(vPAG), the above effects of EA were abolished or reduced significantly. The results suggest that the 
depressor effect of EA on stress-induced hypertensive rats might be mediated by nitric oxide in the 
VPAG due to activation of sympathetic inhibitory system and by attenuated cardiac activities.

The Effects of Smiling or Crying Facial Expressions on Grip Strength, 
Measured With a Hand Dynamometer and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test 
Kemal Nuri Özerkan, M.D. 
Assistant Professor and Chairman of Department of Sports and Health Sciences, Istanbul University, 
School of Physical Education and Sports
The effects of smiling or crying facial expressions on grip strength and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test were 
evaluated in this study. Ten right-handed basketball players (age group 18-28) were included in the 
study. Grip strength was measured with a Riester hand dynamometer and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test 
successively, after the players had looked at the drawing of a "crying face" for 5 seconds from a distance 
of 40 cm at the eye level. Immediately afterwards they were shown the drawing of a "smiling face" and 
were asked to grip with the same condition. Once all 10 players carried out this experiment, the order in 
which the drawings were shown was reversed. We then proceeded to measure the same variables, using 
the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test. The statistics obtained thereby were subjected to Pearsons correlation 
coefficient and paired t-test. Using a hand dynamometer and the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test, it was found 
that, in both tests, the "smiling face" drawing (first crying, then smiling face: with hand dynamometer, it 
increased from 8.34 ± 0.97 kg to 9.18 ± 0.9 kg; t = 5.39, p = 0.0001) increased the grip strength of the 
basketball players, and the "crying face" drawing (first smiling face, then crying face: with hand 
dynamometer it decreased from 9.35 ± 0.90 kg to 8.51 ± 0.96 kg; t = 9.81, p = 0.0001) decreased the grip 
strength. Exposure to the smiling face drawing increased the grip strength, and exposure to the crying 
face decreased it, in every subject tested in this group. Similar effects were observed with the Bi-Digital 
O-Ring Test (first crying, then smiling: it increased from -2.80 ± 1.13 to 2.20 ± 1.32; t = 33.54, p = 
0.0001; first smiling then crying: it decreased from 2.40 ± 1.34 to -2.20 ± 1.62; t = 15.06, p = 0.0001).

In a previous study, we have reported that acupuncture increases cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus 
after transient global ischemia in gerbils. In the present study, the effect of auricular acupuncture (AA) 
on dentate cell proliferation was examined in appropriately fed and food-deprived adult Sprague-Dawley 
(S-D) rats. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (BrdU) immunohistochemistry revealed a 
significant increase in cell birth in the dentate gyrus of both groups after AA treatment. In addition, the 
effect of AA on cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus was more profound in the food-supplied group. 
These findings demonstrate that AA enhances cell proliferation in the dentate gurus of adult rats.

Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in the cervical and upper back regions is a common medical problem. 
The involved muscles include trapezium, multifidi, splenius cervicis, levator scapulae, supraspinatus or 
infraspinatus. Acupuncture is a well-known method for relief of chronic pain. In this study, we evaluated 
the effect of acupuncture in MPS and its durability by using the concept of meridians. Twenty-nine 
patients with chronic MPS in the upper back and cervical regions received acupuncture 2 times per week 
for 3 weeks. According to the pathways of the meridians, we chose acupuncture points by the pain 
regions located in which parts of meridian passing (i.e., "Where the meridian passes, where to treat the 
disease."). We evaluated the intensity of pain by visual analog scales (VAS) and active range of motion 
(ROM) of neck before and after therapy. After receiving acupuncture for 3 weeks, VAS of pain fell 
significantly from 9.0 ± 1.0 to 4.9 ± 2.5 and active ROM of neck significantly increased from 35.8 ± 10.2 
degrees to 61.3 ± 9.4 degrees (p < 0.05). The onset of symptom relief was gradual and duration of 
symptom relief after a course of acupuncture was average 5.3 ± 1.2 days. In, conclusion, acupuncture is a 
somewhat effective method for pain relief of patients with chronic MPS in the cervical and upper back 
regions. However, the effect of acupuncture with the concept of meridians on MPS is insidious and the 
duration of the relief is not long enough.

The principle aim of the present work is the evaluation of the importance of the variable "depth" of 
needle insertion in the determination of acupuncture's therapeutic results. A randomized clinical trial 
carried out on 44 patients belonging to two groups of 22 each, suffering from shoulder myofascial pain: 
group A: superficial acupuncture; group B: deep acupuncture. All of them subjected to the same model 
of treatment with 13 needles and the treatment of the most painful 4 trigger points (TP) found in the 
shoulder's area. In the group A patients, the needles were introduced in the skin at a depth of 2 mm, on 
the TP. In the group B patients, the needles were placed deeply both in the muscular acupuncture points 
and in the TP. The treatment was planned for a cycle of 8 sessions, the first 4 to be performed twice a 
week, the last 4 weekly. The intensity of pain was evaluated with the McGill Pain Questionnaire before 
beginning the therapy, at the end of the therapy, and at the follow-up after 1 and 3 months. Both 
techniques had efficacy in controlling pain. A statistically 229 significant difference rose between the 
two needling techniques at the end of the treatment and at the follow up after one and three months. Deep 
acupuncture shows to be better at all times and this underlines the importance of the muscular afferences 
in acupunctural stimulation in the control of pain.

Several studies find that manual acupuncture and transcutancous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are 
via different mechanisms and generate different effect on the central nervous system, therefore, the aim 
of the present study was to compare the effect of manual acupuncture (MA) and TENS on the spinal cord 
using H-reflex recordings. A total of 13 healthy adult volunteers were studied. The electrical stimuli were 
delivered to the posterior tibia] nerve transcutaneously at the left popliteal fossa to evoke the soleus H-
reflex. MA, 2Hz TENS, 100HZ TENS, respectively, was applied to the surface of the right first dorsal 
interosseous muscle exactly at the Hegu acupoint (LI.4). Four assessments were performed randomly, 
separated by an interval of at least three days in all the subjects as follows: 1) Control assessment: a pair 
of electrodes placed on the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4), but no electrical stimulation was 
delivered throughout the test; 2) MA assessment: MA was done at the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) for 15 
minutes; 3) TENS assessment at 2Hz: electrical stimulation (40 mA in intensity) at 2Hz was applied to 
the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) for 15 minutes; 4) TENS assessment at 100HZ: electrical 
stimulation (20 mA in intensity) at 100 Hz was applied to the surface of the right Hegu acupoint (LI.4) 
for 15 minutes. Each assessment was divided into three periods as follows: 1) Baseline period: H-reflexes 
recorded prior to MA or TENS; 2) TENS period: six H-reflex recordings after MA or TENS for a 
duration of 4-5 min, 9-10 min and 14-15 min, respectively; 3) Post TENS period: H-reflex recordings of 
6 after TENS period 4-5 min and 9-10 min, respectively. Our results indicate that both 2Hz TENS and 
100HZ TENS increased the amplitude of the H-reflex, and that these increases may be retained longer 
with 100 Hz TENS than with 2 Hz TENS, whereas MA could not increase the amplitude of the H-reflex. 
MA, TENS at 2 Hz or 100 Hz didn't change the latencies of the H-reflexes. We conclude that both 2Hz 
and 100Hz TENS increased the amplitude of the H-reflex, suggesting that TENS enhances the 
excitability of the motoneuron pool in the spinal cord, and 100 Hz TENS has a greater effect than 2 Hz 
TENS, whereas MA was not similar effect to TENS on spinal cord.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and clarify the usefulness of different spectral characteristics of 
myoelectrical activity in the follow-up of development of muscle fatigue. Vastus lateralis (part of 
quadriceps) muscle loaded in a simple isokinctic exertion test was used as a model. Twelve, well trained 
athletes served as study subjective to minimize the inter-individual variations. They went through one-
minute test with isokinetic device at the range of 90 degrees extension and flexion at the level of their 
maximal force. The myoelectrical signals were registered from middle of the vasttis lateratis muscle by a 
computerized fast Fourier transform analyzing system based on 80286 and 80287 microprocessors and 
using surface electrodes. Mean power frequency (MPF) was 65.6 (SE = Standard Error, 1.6) Hz, median 
frequency (MF) 55.8 Hz and zero crossing rate (ZCR) 92.5 (SE 1.5) during first performance. All these 
parameters decreased apparently linearly and significantly from the beginning of the test (P < 0.001). The 
decrease rate of ZCR was fastest and MF slowest. The area of power spectrum (PSA) was 1753 (SE 320) 
units during first performance, and it increased markedly with slightly accelerating rate during the test. In 
conclusion, for the evaluation of the muscular performance during the development of fatigue it is 
beneficial to monitor simultaneously MPF, MF and ZCR.

Atlanto-Axial Subluxation Syndrome and Management of Intractable 
Headache, Neck Pain and Shoulder Pain With Auricular Stimulation: A 
Clinical Case Report 
Ki Ho Kim, M.D., FAAPMR, FICAE* 
President/Medical Director, Kim Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine, Livingston, New Jersey, U.S.A.
Atianto-axial subluxation syndrome is a condition that is easily overlooked, misdiagnosed and 
mismanaged. Anatomy, neurovascular involvement and description of clinical manifestations are 
reviewed. Bi-Digital O-Ring Test is employed to establish an accurate diagnosis and its value and 
accuracy described briefly. Bi-Digital O-Ring Test has been an important diagnosis confirmation method 
(reconfirmed by CT or MRI in over 95% of more than 850 clinical cases) in this author's practice of 
spinal disorder and intractable pain management. A newly described device, the KIM-STIMTM offers 
auricular stimulation of multiple points, using electrical microcurrent. Each unit is individually custom-
molded to the patient's ear, and fitted with multiple electrodes. It was found to be very effective in 
managing the majority of intractable pain, especially pain requiring multiple daily treatments in order for 
the patient to live and function normally. The KIM-STIMTM device allows the patient to self-manage the 
pain by day or night, thus allowing for a reduction or elimination of medication intake and diminishing 
the necessity for frequent doctor visits.

Effects of Electroacupuncture on Blood-Brain Barrier after Cerebral 
Ischemia-Reperfusion in Rat

The effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after cerebral ischemia-
reperfusion (I-R) was investigated in rats. The dye Evans Blue (EB) was used as a tracer for assessing the 
disruption of BBB. Fluorescence quantification of EB was performed to explore the temporal pattern of 
permeability of BBB after the cerebral I-R with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI 650-60). 
Furthermore, the morphology of BBB opening was detected under confocal laser scanning microscopy 
system. It was found that the BBB opening after cerebral I-R was biphasic. A rare scattered extravasation 
of EB was detected 2 hours after cerebral I-R. The EE extravasation reached its first peak at 6 h then 
decreased at 24 h and increased again at the time-point of 48h after cerebral I-R. EA can attenuate the 
disruption of BBB after cerebral I-R. EA could not only limit the area of extravasation of EB, but also 
reduce the concentration of extravasation of EB in the rat brain after cerebral I-R. The results indicated 
that one of the mechanisms of curative effect of EA on the cerebral ischemia might be due to its function 
of protecting the integrity of BBB.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the temperature distributions around the acupuncture points and 
channels by visualizing the infrared emissions emanated from the human skin. Our thermal imaging 
system that is the most sensitive to 10µm long infrared wavelength allows us to recognize the actual 
location of acupuncture point and analyze its functional condition by examining the temperature gradient 
between the point and its surrounding skin area. The temperature perception of acupuncture point on 
extremities is especially important since its location and functional condition have a tendency to be 
altered if one contract disease such as immunodeficiency, arterial hypertension, and dyskinesia of biliary 
ducts. Also, thermovisual examinations over the acupuncture points allow us to perform the objective 
medical treatments by observing the transition of temperature gradients.

In the current study the effect of electrode placement on cutaneous blood flow and skin temperature were 
assessed using laser Doppler flowmetry. Following approval from the University's ethical committee, 30 
subjects were recruited (15 male: 15 female) and randomly assigned to a control or one of two treatment 
groups (n=10 all groups). TENS was applied either over the median nerve or to the Hegyu acupuncture 
point (L.I.4) for 15 minutes. Blood flow and skin temperature data were recorded during TENS and for 
15 minutes post TENS. Analysis of results showed significant differences between groups for cutaneous 
blood flow (p=0.0001; repeated measures ANOVA). There was a significant increase in blood flow in the 
TENS median nerve group compared with the other two groups during TENS application. No significant 
changes in skin temperature were observed between groups. This study demonstrates that the effect of 
TENS upon cutaneous blood flow is dependent upon electrode placement sites.

To explore the alteration of melatonin (MT) levels in pineal, hippocampus and serum during seizure 
crises and electroacupuncture (EA) anti-seizures, we established a rat seizure model by microinjecting 
benzylpenicillin into hippocampus. EA was performed on "Fengu" (DU 16) and "Jinsuo" (DU 8) 
acupoints in rats. Electroencephalogram (EEG) of rats was recorded and the relative power (RP) of 1-30 
HZ band of EEG was analyzed. A capillary electrophoresis-electrochemical detection method was used to 
determine MT contents. Our results indicated that MT level was elevated in pineal and hippocampus, and 
first had no change then significantly evaluated in serum during seizure crisis. The elevation of MT level 
was greatly potentiated with 30 min EA treatment (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the degree of seizures and the 
increases of EEG RP induced by seizures were significantly reduced (P<0.05). Because MT was 
considered as an antistressor and a natural downregulator of epileptiform activity, we postulate that the 
elevation in MT level during seizures may be one endogenous mechanism that counteracts convulsions 
and seizure-induced stress. A further elevation of MT levels with EA treatment suggests that MT might 
be one of the possible mediums of EA anti-seizures.

The aim of the present study was to observe the alternation of central orphanin FQ (OFQ, also known as 
nociceptin) system while electroacupuncture (EA) combined with melatonin (MEL). The experiments 
were carried out to investigate the changes of OFQ-like immunoreactivity and prepro-orphanin FQ 
(ppOFQ) MRNA in some certain nuclei of the rat brain. Using immunohistochemical technique we found

that the level of OFQ-like immunoreactivity was increased significantly in some pain-modulation-related 
nuclei, such as ventro-medial hypothalamic nucleus, raphe magnus nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus and 
periaqueductal gray (PAG) after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MEL 60 mg/kg, and it was further 
enhanced while MEL combined with EA. By using in situ hybridization, we found that ppOFQ MRNA 
expression was decreased in the same nuclei after the administration of MEL, and further decreased 
following the combination of EA and MEL. The results suggested that attenuating the release and 
synthesis of OFQ in the brain is one of the mechanisms that melatonin promotes acupuncture analgesia.

From a clinical perspective, the alternative forms of acupoint stimulation including electroacupuncture, 
moxibustion and acupressure appear to have more potent analgesic effects than manual needle 
acupuncture. Bee venom (BV) injection has also been reported to produce persistent nociceptive 
stimulation and to cause neuronal activation in the spinal cord. In previous study, we observed that BV 
stimulation into acupoint, namely BV acupuncture or Apipuncture, produced more potent anti-
inflammatory and antinociceptive potency in rodent arthritis model as comparing with that of non-
acupoint injection. Based on previous report, we decided to further investigate that BV injection into an 
acupoint produces antinociception as a result of its potent chemical stimulatory effect in both abdominal 
stretch assay and formalin test. Different doses of BV were injected into an acupoint or a non-acupoint 30 
min prior to intraplantar formalin injection or intraperitoneal acetic acid injection. Using the abdominal 
stretch assay, we found that the high dose of BV (1:100 diluted in 20µl saline) produced a potent 
antinociceptive effect irrespective of the site of BV injection. In contrast the antinociceptive effect 
observed in both the writhing and formalin tests following administration of a low dose of BV (1:1000 
diluted in 20µl saline) was significantly different between acupoint and non-acupoint sites. BV injection 
into an acupoint (Zhongwan, Cv. 12) was found to produce significantly greater antinociception than non-
acupoint injection (10 mm from Zhongwan, Cv. 12) in the abdominal stretch assay. Similarly, in the 
formalin test, acupoint (Zusanii, St. 36) injection of BV produced more potent antinociception than non-
acupoint injection (gluteal muscle). In contrast, BV injection into an arbitrary non-acupoint site on the 
back did not produce antinociception in either the writhing or formalin test. These results indicate that 
BV injection directly into an acupoint can produce a potent antinociceptive effect and suggest that this 
alternative form of acupoint stimulation (Apipuiicture) may be a promising method for the relief of pain.

The present study was to investigate the dynamic changes of cellular immune function of rats with 
intrathecal injection of (ith) morphine and the regulatory effect of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation on 
'Zusanli" (St.36) and "Lanwei" (Extra 37) points. The results showed that ConA-induced rat spleen 
lymphocyte proliferation was significantly decreased on 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h after ith morphine 
(40µg/5OµL). The proliferative response was recovered to nearly normal on 72h. EA on corresponding 
periods could prevent the decrease of lymphocyte proliferative response of rats induced by ith morphine. 
The same tendency was observed on the induction of IL-2 production. Further study continued to explore 
the mechanism of the potentiating effect of g-opioid receptor in periaqueducial gray (PAG) and 
hippocampus on the immunosuppression induced by ith morphine at molecular level with in situ 
hybridization histochemistry technique. The results showed that ith morphine could increase the 
expression of p-opioid receptor mRNA.

Osteoreflectory Treatment of Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome and Craving for 
Alcohol in Patients with Alcoholism

Osteoreflexotherapy is used alone as a treatment used for alcohol abstinence syndrome and for alcohol 
craving by intraosseal stimulation of the processus styloideus ulnae of the patient's left and right hands as 
well as the processus spinosus of the seventh cervical vertebra and the manubrium sterni osteoreceptors. 
This is done by intraosseal injection of 0.5 to 1.0 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution during a period of 3 to 5 
seconds. Craving for alcohol and depressed mood, strongly manifested Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome 
(AAS) symptoms before osteoreflexotherapy, were reduced in a most convenient and fast manner under 
the influence of two sessions of osteoreceptive stimulation. The withdrawal symptoms caused by alcohol 
abstinence decreased markedly during the first two hours after the first osteoreflexotherapy treatment, 
continued to decrease in the next 24 hours and by the time the second osteoreflexotherapy session was 
given, the withdrawal symptoms completely disappeared in 72 hours. The most slowly and least reduced 
AAS symptoms were asthenia and disturbances of postular equilibrium. Based on clinical observations, it 
is speculated that osteoreceptive stimulations destroy ethanol dependent functional systems and restore 
the neurophysiological and neuromediatorial integration of the brain in alcoholism patients. Primarily 
becauseo f these two cited factors, the patient can be freed of the craving for alcohol for several years, and 
he or she also does not suffer from depression.

Republic of China 
The influence of morphine and EA on the apoplosis of thymocytes were studied to investigate the 
possibility of its involvement in the mechanism of the morphine-induced immunosuppression and the 
regulatory effect of EA on it. lh after injecting 50 mg/kg morphine subcutaneously into 3-wk old Balb/c 
mice continually twice a day for 5 days, thymus was collected and the apoptotic cell was detected by a 
method of terminal deoxynucteotidyl transferase-meditaed DUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). The 
results showed that morphine significantly enhanced the percentage of TUNEL positive cells inside 
thymus with an appearing of apostolic DNA ladder after 24 h incubation. Treating mice with EA of 
"Zusanli(St.36)" and "Lanwei(Ext.33)" for I h after morphine administration decreased the percentage of 
TUNEL positive cells. EA also showed a regulatory effect on the increased the expression of CPP32 and 
decreased the expression of Bcl-2 by morphine. The significant enhancement of hypothalamic CRF and 
plasma ACTU level by morphine and the antagonize effect of EA on it suggested a possible role of 
Hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal (HPA) axis played in the apoptosis of thymocytes by morphine and the 
regulatory effect of EA.

Although the opioid system plays a pivotal role in the analgesic effect of electroacupuncture (EA), it has 
been suggested that other peptidergic systems also may be involved in the therapeutic effect of EA. 
Among several peptides for EA-induced analgesia, catecholainine (CA) is associated with the descending 
pain inhibitory system. We evaluated whether the different frequencies of EA modified the cellular 
activity of central CA synthesizing neurons using double labeling immunohistochemistry between Fos-
like immunoreactive (FLI) neurons and dopamine-p-hydroxylase (DBH)/tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-
positive neurons. We observed that different frequencies of EA increased the number of FLI neurons in 
catecholaminergic neurons, such as the dorsal raphe (DR), hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Are), locus 
coeruieus (LC), A5 noradrenaline cells (A5), and A7 noradrenaline cells (A7). In addition, different 
frequencies of EA significantly increased the ratio of colocalization between FLI neurons and TH positive 
neurons in Dr, LC and Arc. Only low frequency IA increased the neuronal activity in Arc. The ratio of 
double labeling between FLI and DBH positive neurons was also elevated at both LC and A5. These data 
demonstrate that different frequencies of IA increase the cellular activity of central CA synthesizing 
neurons, suggesting that the CA system plays an important role in EA-induced analgesia.

The present study was designed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) is able to regulate glial 
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression following transient middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (MCAO) using reverse id transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry 
in rats. The results indicate that after 2 h MCAO, GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity profoundly 
increased in peri-infarct cerebral cortex, with peaks at 2 h after reperfusion, then declined dramatically at 
12 and 24 h after reperfusion. Although EA given immediatelly after MCAO couldn't elevate the peaks of 
GDNF expression, it obviously raised the GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels at 12 h after 
reperfusion, delayed the declining trends of GDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity levels. These results 
suggest that EA could upregulate GDNF expression after ischemic insult, elongating the duration of 
upregulated GDNF expression. This may be one of the mechanisms of EA anti-ischemic injury by 
augmenting endogenous protective mechanism.

and 61 GHz, intensities from 2 0.1 to 7 mW/cm2, the exposure time for 3 min. or 10 min.) applied to 
ipsilateral acupoint St.36 were studied. It was found that the millimeter-wave bioresonance therapy 
improved the condition of experimental animals, accompanying by diminution of licking reaction which

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important diffusible neurotransmitter, which also has neurotoxicity when it is 
overproduced. To investigate whether electro-acupuncture (EA) could inhibit the excessive NO release 
during cerebral ischemia, we detected NO directly by our self-made NO sensitive electrode. The electrode 
was placed into rat striatum after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. NO level was significantly 
increased upon the onset of ischemia and reperfusion. EA apparently antagonized the ischemia-elicited 
rise of NO, although it could not suppress the NO level to baseline. The results indicated that EA might 
inhibit directly the elevation of NO following cerebral ischemia.

We evaluated the analgesic effect s of acupuncture on postoperative pain by comparing patients who 
underwent routine tooth extraction alone (control group) and those who underwent tooth extraction in 
combination with acupuncture (experimental group) by the random allocation method. As teeth easy to 
extract, requiring no gingival incision (grade A) or those difficult to extract, requiring gingival incision or 
bone cutting (grade B). As local anesthesia, 1.8 ml or 3.6 ml of 2% xylocaine was used. The LI.4, Hegu 
on both sides and ST.7, Xiaguan and ST.6, Jische on the affected side were selected. Low frequency 
electrical acupuncture was performed. When acupuncture was used in combination with tooth extraction, 
3 of 22 patients did not develop postoperative pain. In patients with wisdom teeth difficult to extract 
(grade B), acupuncture used in combination with local anesthesia decreased postoperative pain.

penicillin into rat hippocampus to make an epilepsy model and performed electroacupuncture treatment 
on "Feng Fu" (DU 16) and "Jin Suo" (DU 8) points in Wistar rats. Nitric Oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA 
levels of rat hippocampus were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
The neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA markedly increased (P<0.01) and inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA significantly emerged during epilepsy, whereas no significant change in 
epithelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA was observed. EA inhibited the epilepsy and decreased 
nNOS (P<0.01) and iNOS (P<0.01) correspondingly but had no effect on the amount of eNOS mRNA. 
The data suggest that penicillin-induced epilepsy caused an increase in nNOS and iNOS, and the EA 
anticonvulsant effect might be related to the decrease of these nitric oxide synthases.

The Central Mechanism of the Depressor-Bradycardia Effect of

Roles of central adrenergic receptors and opoid receptors in the depressor-bradycardia effect of 3V, 2Hz 
"Tinggong-Quchi" electroacupuncture (the EA-DpB, i.e., the depressor bradycardia induced by 
electroacupuncture) were studied by intracerebroventricula (icv) injection of prazosin, yohimbin or 
propranol, naloxone or by intra-arachnoid (ith) injection of nalaxone. Voltage-dependent depressor effects 
were induced by 2Hz "Tinggong-Quchi" acupuncture. The depressor effect of 3V, 2Hz "Tinggong-Quchi" 
acupuncture was attenuated by icv injection of a b-receptor antagonist-propranalol, but was not blocked 
by the icv injection of an α1 -or (α2 -receptor antagonist prazosin or yohimbin. Icv injected naloxone but 
not ith injected naloxone blocked or reversed the EA-DpB. Results suggest that central P-receptors or 
opoid receptors in the brain are selectively involved in the Ea-DpB.

The Tolosa Hunt Syndrome (THS) is a painful granular inflammation of the cerebral vessels followed by 
pain and disorders of the extrabulbar muscles. The therapy consists of corticosteroids and analgetics. 
There was a 70 year old woman who suffered from painful paresis of the abducent and oculomotor nerves 
following an infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi - but without ocular symptoms. The treatment with 
corticosteroids reduced the palsy but she complained of excessively painful attacks in the region of the 
first branch of the trigeminal nerve. Opiold analgesic therapy did not bring about any relief Acupuncture 
is an irritative method with a physical effect on the nervous system: its pain-reducing effect is caused by 
the activation of transmitters like endorphins in thalamus and brain stem. Knowing this effect, the THS 
patient, after informed consent, was treated with acupuncture. To measure the extent of pain, a visual 
analog scale (0: no pain - 10: maximum pain) was used. Acupuncture was performed according to the 
empirical rules of the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), during a period of 10 weeks and 12 weeks. 
There was a significant pain relief after acupuncture from VAS 1O to VAS 5. The effect vanished during 
the next four months. After a second series of 12 sessions pain reduction was reported from VAS 10 to 4. 
One year after the last Tolosa Hunt Syndrome - intractable pain pain strength ranged between VAS 4 - 6. 
Therefore acupuncture seems to be a good additional method for reduction of intractable pain.

Auricular acupuncture is widely used for the treatment of cocaine addiction, and there is an urgent need to 
conduct controlled clinical research of this intervention. One impediment to this endeavor is the lack of an 
objective and reliable method for identifying the hypothesized active and control points. In order to 
address this issue, we conducted two studies employing a constant current electrical device and a novel 
probing technique. In the first study, we assessed the reliability of our technique for measuring electrical 
skin resistance points (acupuncture or non-acupuncture) on the body and auricles. In the second study, we 
analyzed and compared the measurements of skin resistance of auricular acupuncture and control zones in 
a group of cocaine abusing patients. Findings suggest that our measurement method produced reliable 
measurements, and that active acupuncture zones revealed a significantly different pattern of electrical 
skin resistance readings compared to control zones. This method may be useful for locating active and 
control points in controlled clinical trials of auricular acupuncture.

Electroacupuncture Reduces Rat's Neuronal Ischemic Injury and Enhances 
the Expression of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor

National Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Institute of Acupuncture Research, Shanghai Medical 
University, Shanghai 200032, P.R. China 
The present study was designed to investigate whether the Electroacupuncture (EA) is beneficial to 
extenuate cerebral injuries following transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO), as well as to 
observe the effect of EA on expression of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF)-like Immunoreactivity 
(IR) in rat brains. The results indicate that gross neuronal damages include infarction, swelling and neuron 
loss, accompanied by increased bFGF-like TR expression following MCAO. In peri-infarct striatum, 
bFGF-like TR was mainly located in astrocytes except some neurons also showed an upregulation of the 
TR; in frontoparietal cortex, strong induction of bFGF-like TR was mostly seen in neurons. Both the EA 
applied during ischemia and reperfusion could evidently alleviate cerebral lesion extent, notably 
upregulate the expression of bFGF-like TR in striatum and cortex, but there was no significant difference 
between the effects of EA applied during ischemia and reperfusion, except EA applied during reperfusion 
seems to be more effective in reducing the cerebral swelling. The results implied that, in striatum, 
astrocytes might play an important role in the protection of neuron via the expression of bFGF; whereas in 
cortex, neurons may exert autoprotection through secreting bFGF themselves. One possible protective 
effect of EA lies in regulating the endogenous expression of bFGF.

Instrumental Measurements of Different Homeopathic Dilutions of 
Potassium Iodide in Water

BION, Institute for Bioelectromagnetics and New Biology, Celovška 264, 1 000 LJUBLJANA, Slovenia 
Although more than 200 years have elapsed since the beginning of homeopathy and in spite of numerous 
confirmatory scientific experiments, the so-called memory of water is still a highly disputable and 
controversial theme in scientific circles. To make a contribution to solving this riddle, our research group 
tried to examine memory properties of water by the method of differential corona Kirlian 
electrophotography of water-drop pairs. The method is based on a modified form of Kirlian photography 
with a subsequent thorough computer picture analysis. The potassium iodide (KI) mother solution (0.1M) 
was diluted in the standard way (without potentisation) or with potentisation (succussion by hand - by 
striking the vial 60 times against a large book as used traditionally) to 10-3M, 10-6M, 10-10M, 10-16M, 10-
17M, and 10-24M KI Solutions. In electrophotography method a drop of KI solution was compared with a 
drop of control water. To get a dependable system of results we compared homeopathic dilutions with 
ordinary distilled water, sham-potentised distilled water and non-potentised (standard) solutions. The 
results were analyzed by the Chi-square Goodness-of-fit test and the Sign test. They showed repeatable 
and statistically significant effects of concentration of KI dilutions as well as potentisation on the corona 
discharge process (from p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). This indicates that there is some physical basis of 
molecular (ionic) information imprinted into water.

The effects of acupuncture on the disorders elicited by abnormalities of endocrine system were 
investigated in ovariectomized mice. Female mice (strain; C57BL/6) were ovariectomized (OVX) and 
acupuncture points, Shenshu BL23) on both sides of the back were continuously stimulated by 
subcutaneous needles for 20 days. After completion of experimental sessions, animals were sacrificed and 
specific brain regions were assayed for catecholamine contents by high performance liquid 
chromatography with electro chemical detector (ECD-HPLC). The mitogenic activities of splenic 
lymphocytes were measured by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide 
(MTS) assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay. Furthermore, the effects of needle stimulation on 
learning and memory ability were studied by the step-through type passive avoidance test. Norepinephrine 
and dopamine contents in the frontoparietal cerebral cortex, ventral hippocampus and olfactory bulb were 
decreased in the OVX group, and both MTS activity and ALP activity were decreased 20 days after 
ovariectomy. The mean latent period was also shortened in the passive avoidance test in the OVX group. 
However, applying needle stimulation increased norepinephrine and dopamine contents in the brain 
regions, and enhanced mitogenic activities of splenic lymphocytes. The stimulation also improved 
memory-related behavior. It was concluded from this study that after mice were stimulated by 
subcutaneous needle insertion, overall changes were observed in central nervous system (including 
retention of memory) and immune functions. The study suggests that acupuncture improves the memory 
loss and decrease of immune responses accompanying aging and/or menopause, and that it may have an 
important role in medical care for the elderly.

Role of Dopamine Receptors and the Changes of the Tyrosine Hydroxylase 
mRNA in Acupuncture Analgesia in Rats 
Yan-Qing Wang, Xiao-Ding Cao, and Gen-Cheng Wu
State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Shanghai Medical University, Shanghai 200032, People's 
Republic of China 
Previous studies have shown that dopamine (DA) is involved in electroacupuncture analgesia (EAA). L-
tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP), a DA receptor antagonist was proved to potentiate EAA in both laboratory 
research and clinical practice. In the present study SK&F-38393 and quinpirole (Qui), selective agonists 
of D1 or D2 receptors respectively were injected into nucleus (N.) accumbens of rats to investigate the 
roles of D1 and D2 receptors in the potentiation of EAA induced by l-THP. The injection of D1 agonist 
SK&F-38393 (5µg or 10µg) attenuated the entiation of EAA induced by l-THP, 10 µg SK&F-38393 
attenuated EAA as pot well, while the injection of D2 agonist Qui (10µg or 20 µg) had no effect on EAA 
and the potentiation of EAA induced by l-THP. DA release was shown to increase in EAA in previous 
work, however, whether the synthesis of DA was influenced is still unknown. In the present study, dot 
blot technique was applied to observe the effect of noxious stimulation or electroacupunctuire on the level 
of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA in rat brain. Noxious electric stimulation was found to elevate the 
TH mRNA level in substantia nigra (SN) and hypothalamus, while electro-acupunture attenuated the 
effect of noxious stimulation on TH mRNA. The results indicate that D1 but not D2 receptor in N. 
accumbens plays an important role in EAA. EA might regulate the biosynthesis of DA by altering the TH 
gene transcription.

Microwave Resonance Therapy (MRT) is a novel medical treatment, which represents a synthesis of the 
ancient Chinese traditional knowledge in medicine (acupuncture) and recent breakthroughs in biophysics. 
By affecting the appropriate acupuncture points by the generation of high frequency microwaves (52-78 
GHz), remarkable clinical results are being achieved in surgery, orthopedic and traumatology, 
cardiovascular disorders, urology, gynecology, dermatology, gastroenterology, pulmology, upper 
respiratory tract, cardiology, neurology, and oncology during the last decade - the MRT being 
contraindicated only in the cases of acute pain in the abdomen demanding an operation, pregnancy, and 
menstruation cycle In this paper the quantum-like macroscopic biophysical basis of the MRT and its 
technical details are elaborated too, offering a new insight in the mechanisms of the assembling gap 
junction hemichannels upon the internal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field spatio-temporal 
maximums at the temporary position of the acupuncture system, and, hence, the very biophysical nature 
of the temporary psychosomatic health or disease. The quantum-like coherent characteristics of the MRT 
(sharply-resonant sensory response of the disordered organism, extremely low-intensity and low-energy 
non-thermal biologically efficient MW radiation, and negligible MW energy losses down acupuncture 
meridians) might be viewed as a consequence of the existence of biological nonlocal selfconsistent macro-
scopic quantum potentials, which can give rise to nonlinear coherent EM MW long-range maser-like 
excitations of biological nonlinear absorption medium with the cells as active centers - with acupuncture 
meridians related to eigenfrequencies and spatio-temporal eigenwaves distributions of every individual 
biological quantum system. This suggests that a healthy condition might be considered as an absolute 
minimum (ground state) of the nonlocal selfconsistent macroscopic quantum potential of the organism. 
Some disorders of an acupuncture system correspond to higher minimums of the (spatio-temporally 
changeable) potential hypersurface in energy-configuration space, which possibly explains the higher 
sensory responses of the more excited (more disordered) acupuncture system and the poor MRT sensory 
response of the healthy acupuncture system being already in the ground state. Such a picture also supports 
the EM/ionic "optical" ultra-low frequency modulated MW quantum holographic neural network-like 
function of the acupuncture system (similar to complex-valued oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like 
neural networks), and its essential relation to consciousness, as strongly suggested from biophysical 
modeling of altered states of consciousness. Finally, the ionic aspects of the acupuncture system are 
considered, too, as well as the relation of ultradian (~ 2-hour) nasal rhythm recognized in Indian swara 
yoga and eircadian (~ 24-hour) acupuncture rhythm recognized in Chinese traditional medicine, and their 
significance for maintaining the ionic balance within acupuncture system, as related to overall health.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acupuncture on peripheral lymphocyte 
subpopulations and cerebral catecholamines. In order to examine the effects of acupuncture, two 
experiments were performed. Experiment 1: Eighteen female mice (strain; C57BL/6) at the age of 7 
weeks were divided three groups, (a) sham operated (control; n=6), (b) ovariectomized (OVX; n=6), and 
(c) ovariectomized and stimulated by subcutaneous needles on acupuncture point, Shenshu (BL23) at the 
both sides of the back for 20 days (OVX+Acu; n=6). These animals were sacrificed at 20 days after 
needle insertion, and the splenic lymphoid cells were examined by two-color flow cytometry, using 
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the cell surface antigens, CD3, CD4, CD8a and NK1.1 (CD56). In the 
ovariectomized (OVX) group, the peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly increased and the ratio of 
natural killer (NK) cells (CD3- NK1.1+;CD3 negative, NK1.1 positive) to Tlymphocyles was decreased 
compared to the sham control group. In the ovariectomized with needle insertion (OVX+Acu) group, the 
CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced, but the NK cells ratio was not changed compared to the OVX group. 
Experiment 2: To investigate the acute effects of subcutaneous needle insertion, male C57BL/6 mice (7 
weeks old) were used (n=6, each group). The acupuncture points Shen-shu (BL23) on the backs of the 
male mice were also stimulated by subcutaneous needles for 3 and 7 days. As a result, the CD4/CD8 ratio 
was significantly decreased at day 3 and day 7, compared to the control group. On the other hand the NK 
cells ratio and activated T-cells were increased at day 7. The mitogenic activities in the splenic 
lymphocytes were also increased by acupuncture stimulation at day 3. Catecholamine contents in the 
hippocampus were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with the electrochemical 
detector (ECD-HPLC) method. No significant change was observed in either dopamine contents or 
norepinephrine; however, dopamine metabolite, homovanilicacid (HVA) and DOPAC(3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) were increased at day 3. The study suggests that acupuncture has effects on

Anticonvulsion Effect of Acupuncture Might Be Related to the Decrease of 
Neuronal and Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthases

Research, Shanghai Medical University, Shanghai 200032, P.R.China 
To measure the levels of hippocampal nitric oxide synthase isoforms in penicillin induced epilepsy and to 
test the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on changes of these levels during epilepsy, we injected 
penicillin into rat hippocampus to make an epilepsy model and performed electroacupuncture treatment 
on "Feng Fu" (DU of 16) and "Jin Suo" (DU 8) points in Wistar rats. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA 
levels of rat hippocampus were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
The neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA markedly increased (p<0.01) and inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA significantly emerged during epilepsy, whereas no significant change in 
epithelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA was observed. EA inhibited the epilepsy and decreased 
nNOS (p<0.01) and iNOS (p<0.01) correspondingly but had no effect on the amount of eNOS mRNA. 
The data suggest that penicillin-induced epilepsy caused an increase in nNOS and iNOS, and the EA 
anticonvulsant effect might be related to the decrease of these nitric oxide syntheses.

Stimulation of the auricle is considered to be an effective analgesic technique. The aim of the present 
study is to establish whether there is a correspondence between somatic inflammation and the appearance 
of lower resistance points, and moreover, whether the stimulation of such points has an analgesic effect. 
The study has been conducted on 57 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 120-140 g; 7 of them 
have been used to determine whether inflammation in the paw leads to the formation of lower resistance 
points on the auricle. The 50 remaining animals have been divided into 5 groups: Group 1 [12 animals], 
control were subjected to all manipulations with the exception of the auricle stimulation; Group 2 [12] 
was stimulated with manual acupuncture in the area corresponding to that observed in the above-
mentioned first group of 7 animals; Group 3 [12] was stimulated with 5Hz and 5 mA; electroacupuncture 
(EAP) Group 4 [8] and group 5 [6] were treated with acupuncture and with EAP respectively on points 
believed to be inactive in areas diametrically opposite to the ones observed in the first group. After 
acupuncture, 100 µg capsaicin in 50µL of physiological solution were injected subcutis in the dorsal 
surface of the paw. Edema response was monitored for two hours, with measurement taken every 5 
minutes. 
The results show a reduction in the edema response, only in the group treated with EAP on the 
appropriate points compared to the control group; no variation was observed in the sham groups. 
To conclude, the hypothesis of a somatotopic division would seem to be probable, and it would seem that 
the stimulation of the appropriate areas and the use of an appropriate intensity constitute the two main 
variables influencing the result.

The impedance on the pericardium merdian near Quze (P3) and control points in 12 cases was measured 
by a four electrodes impedance instrument. The amplitude of impedance was recorded before, during and 
after needling the Neiguan. The result showed that the mean impedance on the meridian and control 
points before the needling were 52.8 ± 11.0 (Ω) and 61.7 ± 10.3 (Ω) respectively which had significant 
difference (P<0.05). During the needling, impedance decreased significantly on the meridian by 9.2 ± 5.6 
(Ω) (P<0.001) while impedance decreased by only 0.12 ± 2.4 (Ω) on control points without significance 
(P>0.05). The impedance changed back to 51.1 ± 11.3 (Ω) and 59.9 ± 11.0 (Ω) on the meridian and 
control points respectively during the 5-10 minutes after withdrawing the needling. In some cases, 
impedance changed intermittently during the needling. The experiment implies that interstitial fluid 
increases during the needling by axon reflection and blood capillary expanding which may be one of the 
mechanisms of acupuncture regulation.

Both acupuncture and hypnosis have their distinct applications in the health profession, but combining 
acupuncture therapy with hypnosis has rarely been done for the purpose of therapeutic treatment, perhaps 
because few clinicians have proper training in both disciplines. For needle phobic patients, acupuncture 
treatment can be a dreadful experience, as multiple needles are usually used. It is stressful for both 
clinicians and patients when the patients are put in an extremely apprehensive state. Our research for 
combining both acupuncture and hypnosis has revealed that synergy does exist in both, and that hypnosis 
does augment the effect of acupuncture, resulting in better treatment outcomes. Since many acupuncture 
patients who are needle phobic do not return for further treatment even though acupuncture has rendered 
good therapeutic results for them, stress reduction with hypnosis is, therefore, a welcome complimentary 
adjunct that would enable them to return for further needed acupuncture treatment if and when the factor 
of fear of the needle is removed.

Modulation of Orphanin FQ or Electroacupuncture (EA) on Immune 
Function of Traumatic Rats

People's Republic of China 
Orphanin FQ (OFQ) is a recently discovered 17-amino acid neuropeptide[1-2]. In present paper, 
influence of intracerobroventricular (ICV) administration of OFQ or electroacupuncture (EA) on the 
surgical trauma-induced inhibition of the splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity in rat was observed. The 
results showed that administration of 0.1µg (0.0055 nmol) and 1µg (0.055 nmol) OFQ had no effect on 
the NK cell activity, while 5µg (2.75 nmol) OFQ reduced the NK cell activity in normal rats. However, 
0.1µg, 1µg or 5µg OFQ were found to antagonize the immune function depression caused by surgical 
trauma. The NK cell activity was reduced in normal rats after repeated ICV treatment with antisense 
oligonucleotide (ASO) complementary to bases of translated region of rat OFQ receptor mRNA to block 
the translation of OFQ receptor mRNA into protein. EA stimulation of Zusanli (St. 36) and Lanwei 
(Extra. 37) points also obviously improved the immunosuppression produced by trauma. OFQ combined 
with EA showed antagonism on the suppression, but there was no significant difference compared with 
OFQ (ICV) or EA alone. When blocking the translation of OFQ receptor mRNA with the ASO, the OFQ 
induced anti-immunosuppression effect was completely reversed, but EA still improved the inhibition on 
NK cell activity. The results suggested that the OFQ played a role in the regulation of 
immunosuppression. EA could modulate the suppression of NK cell activity induced by surgical trauma.

The principles of electromyographic (EMG) analysis can be divided into the following groups: signal or 
motor unit shape analysis, amplitude analysis, multi-channel or successive time difference analysis, 
signal frequency composition analysis, change of frequency time based analysis based on simultaneous 
amplitude or frequency based analysis or concentric and excentric work based shape and amplitude ratio 
analysis. The aim of this paper is to present an ambulatory portable device for surface EMG analyzing 
both for integrated EMG and for spectral analysis. The reliability of surface EMG recordings have 
established. The recent new technology gets a possibility to measure by reliable way surface EMG on-
line during exercise, rehabilitation or occupational conditions. Portable EMG measurement unit and 
analyzing program seems to be suitable for documentation of the response of rehabilitation programs, 
effects of physiotherapy, analyzing the muscle balance and activity of sportsman and for documentation 
of occupational health problems. Automatic interpretation and wide data base for patient data makes the 
system useful in daily practice.

Background: There are few studies on acupuncture in childbirth despite the generally established 
analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment 
Methods: The analgesic effect of acupuncture during childbirth was assessed by comparing the need for 
other pain treatments (epidural analgesia using bupivacaine, pudendal nerve block, intramuscular 
meperidine, nitrous oxide/oxygen, intracutaneous sterile water injections) in 90 women given 
acupuncture (acupuncture group) with that in 90 women not given acupuncture (control group). 
Results: 52 women (58%) in the acupuncture group and 13 (14%) in the control group managed their 
deliveries without further pain treatment (p<0.001). The groups were similar with respect to age, pariety, 
duration of delivery, use of oxytocine and incidence of Caesarean section. Acupuncture treatment was 
found to have no major side effects, and 85 women (94%) given acupuncture reported that they would 
reconsider acupuncture in future deliveries. 
Conclusion: Acupuncture reduces the need for other methods of analgesia in childbirth.

Our investigation have confirmed that the osteoreceptive sensory system participates in the polysensoric 
regulation of animal and human posture. Experiments with animals have demonstrated that the irritation 
of osteoreceptors by electric pulses leads to osteoreceptive response potentials of the same parts of the 
brain (Deiter's nuclei, cerebellum, caudate nucleus, cortical motor centre, etc.) which participate in the 
regulation of animal and human posture and other motion acts. Close functional relations have been 
established between the skin, bone, vestibular and muscle sensory systems in the brain structures where 
the osteoreceptive excitation converges. The studies of osteoreceptive sensory system have served as a 
theoretical base for new techniques of posture stabilization. These are based on osteoreceptive irritations 
caused by electrical pulses or by intraosseal pressure increase at injections of the physiological solution. 
It has been found that each bone has its own specific role in posture regulation. In all cases of bone 
irritation the posture stabilization of various degrees has been confirmed. However, it has been 
demonstrated that the most effective results have been obtained by affecting the processus spinosus of 
seventh cervical vertebra and the lower extremity bones, especially those of tibiae and calcaneus.

Republic of China 
The present paper is to study the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on acute ischemic stroke patient and 
acute cerebral ischemic rat. IN clinic, 42 acute ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided into 2 
therapeutic groups: drug group and EA+drug group. Neurological deficits of patients were evaluated 
before and after the treatment by Chinese Stroke Scale. The results showed that the acute ischemic stroke 
patients treated by drug or EA+drug were all partially recovered, but the clinical functional recovery in 
EA+drug group was significantly better than in the drug group (P<0.01). In laboratory, the model of 
reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used in rats. The somatosensory evoked 
potential (SEP) was recorded before and after MCAO. EA was applied one hour after cerebral ischemia

and once a day after reperfusion fo 7 days in EA+MCAO group. It was shown that the amplitude of P1-
N1 wave of SEP before MCAO was 100%. After MCAO 30 min the P1-N1 wave of SEP on the 
ipsilateral side of MCAO was decreased to 2.2 ± 3% (MCAO group), 1.9 ± 2% (MCAO+EA group); and 
then recovered to 25.5 ± 14.1% (MCAO group), 58.6 ± 27.2% (MCAO+EA group) after 7 days of 
reperfusion following MCAO 2 hours. The above results indicated that EA could promote the recovery 
of neurological function in acute ischemic stroke patients and SEP on MCAO rats.

The modality of needle stimulation in acupuncture is part of the concept of the intensity of the 
stimulation, a variable indicating the dosage of the treatment administered. In this study we intend to 
compare the effect of superficial and deep needle insertion in the leg ipsilateral or contralateral to the 
paw treated with capsaicin. Testing was carried out on 100 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 120-140 
g, divided into 5 groups according to the treatment received. Group 1 (20 animals) was kept as control; 
Group 2 (20) received ipsilateral deep acupuncture stimulation; Group 3 (20) received ipsilateral 
superficial acupuncture stimulation; Group 4 (20) received contralateral deep acupuncture stimulation; 
Group 5 (20) received superficial contralateral acupuncture stimulation. Results show that both 
acupuncture modalities are efficient when administered ipsilaterally to the paw where capsaicin is 
injected, while contralaterally only deep stimulation shows a certain efficiency. It is possible to conclude 
that deep insertion has a greater efficiency, probably because it affects a greater number of receptors; 
stimulation is therefore of an intensity greater than that seen in superficial insertion.

Use of Alternative Therapies By a Low Income Population

Patients in a family health center clinic were surveyed about their use of alternative/complementary 
medicine. These were mostly low-income individuals on Medicaid. The aim was to estimate prevalence 
and patterns of use of medically unconventional therapies such as chiropractic, homeopathy, and 
acupuncture in this population. Nearly two hundred patients (N=199) filled out questionnaires inquiring 
about medical conditions and illnesses, personal health habits (physical activity, tobacco smoking, 
alcohol intake, etc.), and use of preventive measures or therapies that are neither taught widely in US 
medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals, and which we refer to as 'alternative' therapies 
(ATs). The term 'alternative' is not intended to imply that ATs are necessarily chosen to replace, rather 
than to be used in combination with standard treatments, although that may indeed be so in specific 
cases. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (58/199) reported using at least one type of AT, as defined for 
the purposes of this survey. Frequency of use varied somewhat, with greatest AT use reported by those 
over 29 years of age with more education and higher incomes (p<0.10, defined as X2sup tests at p<0.10). 
While no significant differences were found between AT users and nonusers with respect to exercise 
participation, alcohol intake or smoking, there was a difference with respect to the reporting of at least 
one medical condition (p<0.01). Among those who have used ATs, 90% reported more than one medical 
condition. Of those reporting no AT use, 70% indicated only a single medical condition for which they 
had sought treatment. In conclusion, use of alternative therapy (AT) appears to be common in all socio-
economic groups, although AT use is apparently slightly less among low-income persons than in the 
general population. It is therefore important for physicians and other medical providers to be aware that 
their patients may be using ATs. Obviously, such practices should be taken into account in case 
management.

The present study was to observe the dynamic changes of tyrosine protein kinase (TPK) activity in 
subcellular fractions in the early stage of activation of T lymphocytes from normal and traumatized rats, 
and the regulatory effect of electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation on it. The results showed that the 
activities of TPK in membranous and cytosolic fractions of activated T lymphocytes were increased on 
second 5, and the peak was on second 45 after ConA stimulation. Then it was decreased gradually. 
Comparing with the control group, the activities of TPK in membranous and cytosolic fractions of 
activated T lymphocytes from the traumatized rats were inhibited in various degrees especially in 
membrane. EA of "Zusanli"(ST-36) and "Lanwei"(Extra 33) points could enhance the activity of TYPK 
in subcellular fractions of activated T lymphocytes from the traumatized rats. The results indicated that 
EA stimulation could prevent the inhibition of activation of TPK induced by trauma stress, and 
contribute to transmembrane signal transduction of T lymphocytes.

Analgesic Effect of Subcutaneous Administration of Oxygen-Ozone. A Blind 
Study in the Rat on the Modulation of the Capsaicin-Induced Edema 
Francesco Ceccherelli, Giuseppe Gagliardi, Luigi Faggian, Fortunato Loprete, and Giampiero Giron
Regulatory Center on Complementary Medicine, Institute of Anesthesiology, University of Padova, -
A.I.R.A.S. - Padova 
The Authors have explored a new complementary approach, employed in the last 40 years for, among 
other uses, medical purposes: oxygen-ozone therapy. Anecdotal works have highlighted interesting 
results obtained in disk herniation with infiltration of paravertebral muscles with oxygen-ozone. To 
verify the existence of a nociceptive effect and investigate a possible mechanism of action, an 
experimental model of edema induction by subcutaneous capsaicin injection in the rat paw was 
employed. Oxygen-ozone, in different concentrations (10 µg/ml, 20 µg/ml and 30 µg/ml) has been 
injected both ipsi- and contralaterally to the paw 30 minutes before the administration of 50 µg capsaicin 
in 50 µl of physiological solution. Results show that the contralateral injection of the O2-O3 mixture 
modulates the edema response in the paw. Statistical significance, for the 20 µg/ml mixture, lasts as far 
as 45 minutes after administration of the capsaicin. No efficacy has been found for the 10 and 30 µg/ml 
concentrations. An injection of the same quantity of gas in the ipsilateral paw to the capsaicin-induced 
edema determines a worse edema than that observed in the control group, as if the ozone mixture added 
its irritative effect to that of capsaicin. It is interesting to note that the administration of oxygen alone 
cause a greater edema than the oxygen-ozone mixture.

It is well established that the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes are composed of long arrays of 
(TTAGGG)n.(CCCTAA)n that form a nucleoprotein complex required for the replication and protection 
of chromosome ends. Throughout the cell cycle, telomeres also contain a protein component related to 
the proto-oncogene Myb that is known as TRFI (telomere TTAGGO repeat binding factor 1) that binds 
to the duplex array of TTAGGG repeats in the telomere. Previous studies have shown that TRF I appears 
to play a role in controlling the length of telomeres by acting as an inhibitor of telomerase. The amount 
of each of the TRFI(C-19) & TRFI(N-19) was identical to the amount of telomere of the same organ of 
the same apparently normal individual. Using synthesized basic unit of TTAGGG, as well as CCCTAA, 
as separate reference control substances for the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test of Resonance Phenomenon 
between 2 identical substances, we were able to non-invasively measure the approximate amount of 
TTAGGG and CCCTAA units, in both normal and cancerous human cells. We examined about 30 
apparently normal subjects (both Asian and Caucasian in both sex). The subjects' ages ranged from 
infancy to 76 years. Each subject was first examined using TTAGGG as a control substance and then 
examined using CCC7AA as a control substance. The amount of telomere in various cancer tissues are 
almost always higher than that of normal tissue of the same organ. The measured amounts of both 
TTAGGG and CCCTAA were found to be in an average of 1500-1600 ng for human fetus or infancy and 
decreased with the advance of age in both sex with the exception of the heart, brain, eyes (retina), testes, 
and ovaries, which usually remain at the level of the infant, or reduced very little. Individuals in the same 
age group had a similar range of amounts of both TTAGGG and CCCTAA in the same organ of the same 
individual, (except for those with unusually low telomeres often had chronic degenerative diseases, and 
those who had exception0y high telomere levels often had excellent physical conditions or mental 
acumen). The amounts of measured TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules before and after acupuncture on 
St.36 in adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma coexisting in the lung of a 54-yr.-old Asian male 
were: telomere in adenocarcinoma decreased from 950 ng to 750 ng and telomere in small cell carcinoma 
http://www.cognizantcommunication.com/filecabinet/Acupuncture/acuabs23.html (9 of 10) [11/4/2002 11:59:39 PM]
 acuabs23
decreased from 770 ng to 600 ng. When the cancer treatment is effective, the amount of telomere is 
reduced towards the value of the normal internal organ. We found that acupuncture on St.36 on 
apparently normal subjects increased the telomere levels up to a maximum of more than 2 times their 
telomere levels prior to the treatment, depending on the method of treatment, but frequently increases 
were between 60% to 100%. Strong Shiatsu performed on St.36 produced a somewhat lesser effect than 
acupuncture. We also determined the amounts of TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules non-invasively in 3 
mummified Egyptian sisters from the 8th Century BC on exhibit at the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy in 
order to estimate their approximate ages (at the time of death). The amounts of body telomere were 500 
ng, 550 ng, and 750 ng. For the prehistoric Iceman (about 3350 B.C. to 3310 B.C) discovered in 1991 in 
the Italian Otzal Alps at about 3,200 meters altitude, estimated body telomere was about 400 ng and 
telomere in brain and heart was 1600 ng, similar to that of a contemporary human being. Although these 
studies are preliminary, the findings may have potential applications not only in anti-aging, cancer 
treatments, and pathophysiology of brain and heart, but also for the estimation of the difference in the 
ages of cadavers studied in archeology and forensic medicine.

 Massage therapy for the treatment of painful peripheral 
neuropathy in HIV+ individuals.  
Int Conf AIDS. 1998;12:849 (abstract no. 42376). Unique Identifier : AIDSLINE ICA12/98404360  
Acosta AM; Chan RS; Jacobs J; New York Hospital, Cornell Medical Center, NY, USA.  
 
Abstract: ISSUE: HIV+ individuals may present with complaints of painful peripheral neuropathy which 
may not adequately respond to pharmacologic therapy. PROJECT: HIV+ individuals with painful peripheral 
neuropathy of the feet who had partial or no improvement in pain after pharmacologic therapy (i.e. narcotic 
analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants and/or serotonin reuptake inhibitors) were referred to occupational 
therapy (OT) for pain management and treatment from 09/11/95 to 10/24/96. OT treatment consisted of 8 
sessions of massage therapy and instruction on a self performed home massage program. No changes in 
medications were made during the duration of the project. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was used to 
measure quality and intensity of pain (scale: 1-10 points) prior to initiating OT massage therapy and after 8 
treatment sessions. RESULTS: Seven HIV+ individuals (4 males; 3 females) with an age range of 28 to 49 
years (mean 39.1) received 8 OT massage therapy treatments over an average of 58 days (range 25 to 126 
days). Five patients reported improvement with a mean decrease in pain of 3.2 (range: 1 to 7). The mean 
CD4 count in the responder group was 183 (range 17-336). One female reported no response to therapy 
(CD4 = 114) and one male reported worsening pain (CD4 = 247). Both non-responders were diabetic. None 
of the responders had diabetes. LESSONS LEARNED: OT massage therapy decreased the intensity of 
painful peripheral neuropathy of the feet in 5 of 5 non-diabetic, HIV+ individuals who had previously had little 
or no response to pharmacologic therapy. Two diabetic HIV+ individuals did not report improvement. OT 
massage therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathy in some HIV+ 
individuals.

samples were obtained for the determination of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and 
cortisol 45 minutes before the start of massage and approximately one hour 
after completion of massage. Cortisol, but not catecholamine, concentrations 
decreased consistently after massage (median difference -35.8 nmol/l; 95% 
confidence interval - 0.5 to -94.0, Wilcoxon matched pairs). There was a slight 
decrease in skin temperature (median difference -0.36 degrees C, 95% 
confidence interval -0.09 to -0.65) but there was no change in oxygenation or 
oxygen requirement. This study has shown that it is possible to detect an 
objective hormonal change following a supposedly 'non-therapeutic' intervention 
in preterm infants. The development of such methods of assessment are likely to 
be of particular relevance in the extremely immature or ill neonate in whom 
behavioural evaluation cannot play more than a limited part.  
 
 
 An Even Closer Look at Therapeutic Touch 
To the Editor.—As a clinician, I am surprised that THE 
JOURNAL elected to address the important and controversial 
issue of Therapeutic Touch (TT) with such a simpleminded, 
methodologically flawed, and irrelevant study. The experimentsdescribed 
are an artificial demonstration thatsomenumber 
of self-described mystics were unable to “sense the field” of 
the primary investigator’s 9-year-old daughter.1 This hardly 
demonstrates or debunks the efficacy of TT. The vaguely described 
recruitment method does not ensure or even suggest 
that the subjects being tested were actually skilled practitioners. 
More important, the experiments described are not relevant 
to the clinical issue supposedly being researched. Therapeutic 
Touch is not a parlor trick and should not be investigated 
as such. Rather, it is a therapeutic technique that may be discoveredto 
require activeinvolvementbyagenuinely ill patient, 
as the authors themselves convolutedly acknowledge in their 
citation of Krieger’s work. Thus, to demonstrate a child’s participation 
in a magic trick hardly represents an investigation of 
a clinical phenomenon. It is not yet clear if TT will be proven to 
be effective and for which, if any, indications. A serious and 
appropriately designed clinical study is needed to determine its 
efficacy, not an elementary-school science project.

To the Editor.—Bias occurs when researchers take a holistic 
process, such as TT,1 extract 1 aspect of the process, and measure 
it in a separate situation. When the experiment fails to 
prove what the researchers hypothesized, they then declare 
thewholeprocess worthless.Thefact that this declarationwas 
derived from a sample size of 21 further validates bias on the 
part of the researchers and the editors. Furthermore, to dismiss 
large volumes of research, including double-blind studies, 
as incompetent research means the authors never thoroughly 
evaluated or considered the merit of the articles listed 
as references. Moreover, I care very little whether a practitioner 
can feel energetic exchange successfully in a contrived 
situation such as the experiment set up when I see outcomes 
that the TT process as a whole works. Much about the mechanisms 
of energetic transfer and healing is not understood. To 
take 1 reductionistic experiment and make sweeping statements 
is an irresponsible research process. Encouraging further 
reasonable research intosomeof thesemechanismswould 
be a positive outcome to this negative experience. 
Finally, the authors’ statement, “The American Holistic 
Nursing Association offers certification in ‘healing touch,’ a 
TT variant” is incorrect. The certifying body is Healing Touch 
International, Inc, with headquarters in Lakewood, Colo. 
Healing Touch is a continuing education certificate program 
endorsed by American Holistic Nurses’ Association.

To the Editor.—Members of the greater Kansas City chapter 
of Nurse Healers–Professional Associates are disappointed in 
the authors’ use of a child’s fourth-grade science project to 
support an anti-TT crusade.1 To describe this child’s homework 
as “research” is without foundation since it clearly fails 
to meet the criteria of randomization, control, and valid intervention. 
The “researcher’s” qualifications to conduct research 
and those of her mother are nonexistent. Flagrant violations 
againstTTinclude the fact that “sensing” an energy field is not 
TT but rather a nonessential element in the 5-step process; 
inclusion of many misrepresentations of cited sources; use of 
inflammatory language that indicates significant author bias; 
and bias introduced by the child conducting the project being 
involved in the actual trials. 
As health care professionals, we welcome healthy skepticism, 
as long as it is born of honestyandintegrity. In fact,many 
 TT practitioners start as skeptics but are compelled to continue 
TT after observing many individuals who benefit. Some 
patients acknowledge pain relief. Others experience relaxation, 
accelerated wound healing, and emotional reintegration. 
Through rigorous research, which does not include elementary- 
school science projects,wemayone day gain a more 
thorough understanding of TT. It is unfortunate that JAMA 
would publish articles that deliberately fragment the TT process 
to achieve erroneous results to further the authors’ own 
biases. Therapeutic Touch practitioners, health care professionals, 
and the public deserve better.

To the Editor.—Ms Rosa and colleagues1 claim that “the definitive 
test ofTTis not a clinical trial of its alleged therapeutic 
effects, but a test of whether practitioners can perceiveHEFs 
[human energy fields].” The definitive test of a healing practice 
is whether healing takes place, not whether the practitioners 
have a flawless grasp of the natural forces at work. 
If TT practitioners predicted their success in a study like 
this one, then the test shows only that the TT practitioners do 
not have an accurate grasp on the healing processes at work, 
if any. Perhaps intention of the patient matters quite a lot,

even though this is discounted by the practitioners themselves. 
Perhaps a TT practitioner must intend to heal as opposed 
to intend to choose a left or right hand. 
The authors’ sweeping pronouncement that “the claims of 
TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified 
is not appropriate.” Such is evidence of a personal and 
not entirely objective agenda, no doubt consistent with that of 
Quackwatch Inc, the Questionable Nurse Practices Task 
Force, the National Council Against Health Fraud, Inc, and 
the National Therapeutic Touch Study Group. One would expect 
medical professionals to be more concerned with whether 
real healing occurs.

To the Editor.—Research design flaws in the study by Ms 
Rosa and colleagues1 are disturbing given the serious nature 
of study results and the suggestion that TT should no longer 
be offered to patients. First, the authors are not neutral and 
unbiased, nor is the senior author representative of nurse scientists 
with advanced degrees currently conducting research. 
Second, it is questionable whether the sampling methods provided 
a representative sample. “Searching advertisements” 
to obtain a sample is purposive and limits generalizability. In 
addition, the authors did not specify what is meant by “following 
other leads” in recruiting participants. Apparent failure of 
theparticipants to question explication of testproceduresfrom 
a 9-year-old child suggests lack of sophistication. Third, no 
rationale is provided for conducting 2 series of tests, and the 
criteria that guided this design are not mentioned. Moreover, 
during the first testing period, there was a lack of equivalency 
in both the time frames used to assess practitioners and the 
settings in which data were collected. The impact of videotaping 
during the second testing period, a complaint registeredby 
several participants, is not addressed. Fourth, the subtle demand 
characteristic of the procedure for testing the hypothesis 
that practitioners should be able to perceive the HEF of 
the experimenter 100% of the time was not representative of 
the patient-practitioner interaction and glosses over the fact 
 that practitioners generally use bothhandsto assess theHEF. 
In the interest of scientific exploration of the efficacy of TT 
and its mechanism of action and the advancement of quality 
patient care,whichis nevermentionedin the article,weshould 
be cautious in following the recommendations of the authors to 
discard an intervention that many patients throughout several 
decades tell us “works.”2

To the Editor.—I critiqued the study on TT1 and was amazed 
that a research study with so many flaws could be published. 
First, the authors list 129 references of which approximately 
only 50 are primary research studies. Of these studies, the 
majority are master’s theses or dissertations from the 1980s, 
and only 9 references are reports of quantitative studies from 
the 1990s.Acloser look at the methods is even more alarming. 
Possible confounders include the wide range of experience of 
the 21 practitioners, demographic characteristics of the participants, 
and lack of evidence of the depth of their training in 
TT. Although the subject was able to “center,” the researcher, 
a young girl who simply held her hand over the upturned palm 
of the practitioner, violated the entire premise of TT. The 
procedure was conducted in different settings with no control 
of environmental conditions. Even though the trials were repeated, 
the subjects did not change, thus claims ofpowerbased 
on possible repetitions of error are inappropriate. The true 
numbers in groups are 15 and 13, thus making a type II error 
highly probable with a study power of less than 30%. Another 
concerniswhetherparticipants signedinformedconsent documents 
or at least were truly informed as to the nature of this 
study and that publication of its results would be sought beyond 
a report to the fourth-grade teacher.

To the Editor.—No study, including the one on TT,1 can prove 
the nonexistence of a phenomenon. The null hypothesis is a 
useful methodologic convention fabricated for the purpose of 
avoiding experimental error. Proper use of hypothesis testing 
contradicts this article’s “unrefuted evidence that the claims 
of TT are groundless and that further professional use is unjustified.” 
The only conclusion is that, under the conditions of 
the experiment, a possible truth had not been discovered (a 
type I or a error—rejecting a hypothesis that actually is true). 
Second, the experimental conditions did not approximate 
the technique of TTas it is practiced. Touch therapists repeatedly 
move their hands over the patient with special attention 
given to perceived problem regions. In this study, a static 
condition was evaluated, eliminating the movement component 
thatmaybe critical. Similarly, a type I hypothesis testing 
error would result when evaluating modern security sensors. 
Under static conditions, these sensors would detect human 
presence 0% of the time. The 100% success rate expected in 
this study was far too stringent. There are few, if any, conventional 
medical tests, evaluations, or therapeutics this successful. 
Unconventional therapies should be scrutinized by 
thesamehigh but not untenable standards used for evaluating 
conventional modalities.Anunreasonably strict experimental 
outcome practically ensures a type I error. The research recommendations 
should include further study, and the practice 
recommendations should await a preponderance of accumulated 
evidence.

To the Editor.—The hypothesis tested by Ms Rosa and colleagues1 
 was not directly related to the authors’ conclusions, 
and the methods of analysis and their interpretations were not 
always appropriate. 
First, the hypothesis tested whether the TT practitioners 
could detect which of their hands was being hovered over by 
the investigator. Because practitioners were not instructed to 
performTTon the investigator, the hypothesis cannot test the 
effectiveness of TT. If TT works well in properly designed 
blinded clinical trials, then whether practitioners can detect 
anHEFunder conditions of this study does not seem relevant. 
Second, the study was designed using the binomial distribution. 
However, it was analyzed using the t distribution, although 
the data do not appear to be approximately normally 
distributed and are not continuous. Even so, Table 2 shows 
that for the initial test the alternative hypothesis that µ = 6.67 
was barely rejected at the .05 level of significance.

The authors state that “the odds of getting 8 of 10 trials 
correct by chance alone is 45 of 1024 (P= .04).” This is the 
probability of getting exactly 8 of 10 trials correct. The probability 
of getting 8 or more correct answers of 10 is 56 of 1024 
(5.5%). More important, if the true probability of a successful 
prediction were 0.67 (considered by this article to be a positive 
trial), then the probability of 0 to 4 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.07, and the probability of 0 to 5 successes in 10 trials would 
be 0.21. Neither are less than 0.05. Therefore, this study is not 
definitive proof that the true probability of success of the practitioners 
is no better than 0.67. 
Figure 2 in the article includes a frequency distribution of 28 
TT practitioners’ scores, although only 21 unique practitioners 
were tested. More than half the original 15 practitioners did not 
participate in the follow-up test, but no reason was given for 
their absence. The mean of the initial test was 4.67; that of the 
follow-uptestwassmaller, 4.08.Theauthorsstatethatalthough 
several practitioners complained about the presence of the television 
crew during the follow-up test, this was irrelevant. 
Further research, preferably properly designed blinded 
clinical trials, is required to prove or disprove the effectiveness 
of TT.

I think it is essential to remember thatmanyinterventionsnow

Nonetheless, handwashing was perceived to have an effect 
on human disease. Similarly, when we wish to definitively

To the Editor.—In describing the theoretical background of

physician Franz Anton Mesmer. Indeed, Mesmer’s mysterious 
and magical cures gained such notoriety in Paris that 
in 1784, King Louis XVI appointed a blue-ribbon panel from 
the prestigiousFrenchAcademyof Sciences to formally evaluate 
this “magnetism.” The panel, which included such wellknown 
scientists as Lavoisier, Guillotin, and Benjamin Franklin, 
verified that some patients indeed had benefited, but they 
dismissed this as having something to do with the “imagination,”

Ms Rosa and colleagues have elegantly refuted the original 
theoretical basis forTT(with its “human energy field”), but as 
in Mesmer’s case, this does not mean TT cannot be helpful to

Can such an entity be measured or perceived? Do any welldesigned 
studies show a beneficial effect against any health 
problem? Our article addressed all of these points. If TT practitioners 
could sense an HEF, they should be able to sense 
whether they are near an experimenter’s hand. None of the 
tested practitionersdemonstratedsuch ability.Noneobjected 
to the study’s design before they were tested. Proponents still 
offer no alternative testable hypothesis or protocol. Nor have 
any stepped forward to attempt to demonstrate the existence 
of an HEF, even though a million-dollar reward is available.1 
Dolores Krieger, PhD, RN, the founder of TT, has stated 
repeatedly that its practitioners senseanenergy field. In 1987, 
she wrote, “In Therapeutic Touch, assessment involves the 
use of the hands in a sensitive search of the healee’s energy 
field, for indications of energy imbalance. Actually, the received 
impression is really an extension of the sense of touch 
as we usually think of it.”2 We leave it to JAMA readers to 
decide for themselves whether it is possible to manipulate an 
“energy field” with their hands if they cannot tell where it is. 
MsCollins asserts that 21 practitionersweretoofewto yield 
valid results. However, our power analysis showed that this 
numberwasmorethan adequate to test our simple hypothesis. 
Therapeutic Touch proponents never have objectively demonstrated 
that they can detect an HEF. Unless they do, it is 
reasonable to assume that none exists. 
Dr Schmidt suggests that our test subjects might not have 
been sufficiently skilled. That would be impossible to determine 
because TT has no accepted standards of training or 
practice. We approached every practitioner we could identify 
in our (Colorado) community. Nearly all agreed to be tested, 
and none was reliably able to detect the location of Emily’s 
hand.3 We see no reason to believe that they were less competent 
than practitioners elsewhere. 
Dr. Palmer is correct that the probability of getting 8 ormore 
correct is slightly higher than the probability of getting exactly 
8 correct. However, this point does not affect the interpretation 
of the test data. Her discussion of the “true probability of a 
successful prediction” being 0.67 is disposed of by our power 
analysis, which she does not contradict. Moreover, TT postulates 
that an HEF can be sensed and manipulated for therapeutic 
benefit. All of our subjects claimed to do this routinely. 
For this to be true, the detection rate would have to be 100%. 
Our study centered on the performance of 28 subjects, not 280 
independent trials. Since a normal distribution was expected 
under the null hypothesis,webelieve the t-distribution was the 
appropriate analytic tool. Our final conclusion was not based 
solely on the hypothesis that practitioners would detect the 
experimenter’s “energy field.” It also took into account—based 
on our literature analysis—that TT has never been shown to 
“work well in properly designed trials.” All 15 original participants 
were invited to be retested. Seven said they were unable 
to attend on the specific day. Only 1 said she didn’t feel she could 
perform“oncamera.”Nocomplaintsweremadeaboutthe presence 
of TV cameras before or during testing. 
DrBlankarguesthatTTmighthavemeritbecauseit is physically 
harmless, might exert a useful placebo effect, and offers 
“the full and unhurried attention of a caregiver.” We believe it 
is inherently harmful to misrepresent placebos as effective 
treatment. Moreover, there are much better ways for nurses 
and clinicians to provide beneficial attention to patients. 
DrIreland expresses concern about discarding an intervention 
that many patients say works. Anecdotal evidence is not 
sufficient to determine whether something works. Our extensive 
literature search found no evidence that TT provides any 
health benefit. Therapeutic Touch proponents still have not 
 stated any grounds on which their claims may be considered 
valid, nor have they presented any reasonable justification for 
TT’s continued professional use.

COHEN, Chapman University School of Law, Anaheim, California 92660 USA writes that 
European providers of complementary medicine may be surprised by the formal strictures faced 
by their American counterparts. 
Discussion: One major hurdle to the practice of holistic medicine in the USA is the statutory 
prohibition against the unlicensed practice of medicine. Because state statutes define "medicine" 
very broadly, this creates a legal risk for unlicensed providers of holistic health care, as well as for 
licensed providers whose services may be deemed to exceed their legislatively authorised scope 
of practice, or who cross into the diagnosis and treatment of disease. 
Results: This review focuses upon the legal status of non-licensed (or "unenfranchised") 
providers rather than the scope of practice. For such providers the seeking of occupational 
licensure could provide a measure of protection against medical practice acts, as well as 
elevating their professional competence and prestige. Many holistic providers, however, prefer to 
remain outside regulatory schemes, and thus mandatory licensure, title licensure and registration 
offer some means of upgrading professional status and the achievement of state sanction for 
professional practice.

RANKIN-BOX, De Montfort University, Cheshire UK writes that due to increased interest among 
the general public and health professionals, there appears to be an assumption that the use 
within the health care setting of complementary therapies such as massage, homoeopathy, 
aromatherapy, reflexology and acupuncture is widespread. To date, however there have been no 
national research studies conducted to validate this assumption. The author conducted an 
informal survey to assess nurses' use of complementary therapies. 
Methods: The study attempted to identify the range of practices and the extent of their use by 
nurses who are members of the Royal College of Nursing Complementary Therapy Forum 
(RCNCTF) in the UK. A convenience sample was used and a semi-structured questionnaire was 
inserted into the group's bi-annual newsletter sent to all members of the RCNCTF (n = 1662). 
Only 178 nurses completed and returned the questionnaire, merely a 9.3% response rate, which 
was partially expected, given the informal nature of the survey and that it was in the form of an 
insert into a newsletter. 
Results: The majority of respondents were aged between 41-50 years, contrary to expectation. 
The 6 main therapies practised were, in order of use): massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, 
relaxation, visualisation and acupuncture. The 3 most common practice areas, including both the 
NHS and the private sector, were: in the community, palliative care and oncology. 
Complementary therapies were more commonly practised in the private sector as part of formal 
working practices, in contrast to nurses working in the NHS, where complementary therapies 
formed less than 20% of their formal nursing care, and where, when used, was often in addition 
to their daily nursing care. 
Conclusions: These results indicate that nurses are practising complementary therapies less than 
generally assumed. The therapies commonly practised are a broader range then those generally 
presented as the primary complementary therapies, namely homoeopathy, acupuncture, herbal 
medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy. Because this survey was from a convenience sample 
focussing upon a self-selected group who were members of the RCNCTF, the findings cannot be 
generalised. However there is a need to identify the national use of complementary therapies 
within the health care setting.

therapies. Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(4): 97-9. Aug 1997. 
WEST, Warwick Hospital UK writes that the availability of acupuncture in midwifery within the 
National Health Service (NHS) has yet to become widespread and that Warwick was one of the 
first hospitals in the UK to offer acupuncture when this service it was set up in September 1993. 
Methods: Acupuncture is offered to patients, alongside conventional treatment, from 6 weeks into 
their pregnancy until 6 weeks following birth. Patients are referred by midwives, GPs or 
consultants, and all professionals work as a team of which the acupuncturist is a complementary 
part. A range of pregnancy-related conditions may be treated and is ideal for patients reluctant to 
take drugs during pregnancy. Diagnosis and treatment are based upon holistic principles rather 
than on symptoms. Because of the risks involved, extreme care is taken when treating during 
pregnancy and certain acupuncture points are prohibited. 
Discussion: The author writes that the immediate and continued success of the acupuncture 
provides the hope that pregnancy and post-natal women elsewhere in the UK may have access 
one day to this ancient holistic treatment without having to pay for it privately.

BAKER, Aromatherapy Organisations Council, Leicester UK writes that although aromatherapy is 
used more and more alongside conventional medicine in hospitals and via GP referrals, doctors 
and other health professionals are concerned regarding training standards, codes of conduct and 
standards of practice. These concerns led to the establishment of a Working Party in 1990 whose 
aim is was to promote a single body for aromatherapy practice. 
Discussion: The range of training courses on offer may appear to be confusing, which is 
compounded by aromatherapy massage courses taught by many further education colleges 
under the health and beauty umbrella, which claim to offer recognised qualifications in 
aromatherapy. This has given rise to the questions: What is a qualified aromatherapy?; What are 
recognised training standards for the profession? Which professional associations are 
recognised? Is there a self-regulating and governing body for aromatherapy and, if so, what is its 
remit? What is the situation with regard to Europe?  
Conclusions: The author describes the role and remit of the Aromatherapy Organisations Council 
(AOC), who are committed to the identification of unified training standards and the maintenance 
of a register of training establishments.

Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(3): 77-80. June 1997. 
VICKERS, Research Council for Complementary Medicine, London UK writes in this review (20 
references) that while there is evidence that massage and aromatherapy may have benefits, 
practitioners make a great number of claims regarding the clinical effects of their treatments. 
Discussion: The author claims that these claims are often presented in the literature as simple 
statements of fact, often with no attempt to explain the basis upon which the claim is made. Even 
when authors do occasionally refer to the scientific literature, this is often done inadequately; in 
some cases the papers cited do not support the claims made. Some authors have given personal 
experience as the source of their knowledge; however it is difficult to generalise statements from 
individual experience. These many inconsistencies found in the massage and aromatherapy 
literature, including different properties conferred upon the same oil, further substantiate the 
allegation that the knowledge basis of these therapies in unreliable. 
Conclusions: Practitioners must develop a critical discourse by which they can evaluate 
knowledge claims. 
Vickers A. Yes, but how do we know it's true? Knowledge claims in massage and aromatherapy. 
Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(3): 63-5. June 1997. 
COMMENTS: It would appear that individuals from all sides of the complementary divide agree 
that there are misconceptions regarding the availability, use and efficacy of complementary 
therapies. Particularly crucial appears to be the need to increase the standards of training and the 
requirement to base claims upon actual research. 
 
Issue 36 
 BOTTING, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Glamorgan, Wales UK writes that 
public interest regarding complementary therapies continues to grow, and that many nurses and 
midwifes incorporate reflexology, aromatherapy and massage into their clinical practice. 
Methods: There are concerns that the effectiveness of these therapies has not been fully 
demonstrated and the author reviews the literature (45 references) regarding the efficacy of 
reflexology. 
Results: Anecdotal evidence is presented and concerns regarding the prevalence of personal 
beliefs and experiences within the literature are voiced and the requirement for research evidence 
advocated. Additionally, there is a critical review of published research studies, focussing upon 
issues relating to methodology, including the use of randomised controlled trials, to determine the 
efficacy of therapies such as reflexology.

Midwifery 3(5): 123-30. Oct 1997. 
STYLES, Paediatric Unit, St Mary's Hospital, London UK writes that aromatherapy is a valuable 
means of maintaining optimum health, especially when the health problem is stress-related. 
Methods: Hospitalisation is a potentially stressful experience as documented by research. The 
author reviews (28 references) how massage and aromatherapy may be of benefit to hospitalised 
children, especially those infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 
Discussion: Nurses should encourage self-healing by "putting the patient in the best condition for 
nature to act". The author states that aromatherapy massage has the potential to achieve this 
through inducing relaxation and reducing the stress of hospitalisation and proposes the 
application of this skill as an extension of the nursing role.

Nurs Midwifery 3(1): 16-20 Feb 1997. 
KACPEREK, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK conducted a survey to determine the 
views of patients regarding the potential value of aromatherapy massage as an out-patient 
service. 
Methods: A structured questionnaire was distributed to 240 patients. 71% (n = 170) of the 
patients responded. 
Results: The majority of respondents replied that they would use an aromatherapy massage out-
patient service, subject to various factors which could affect their decision. These considerations 
included: having a trained practitioner, reputable premises, the gender of the practitioner, cost of 
treatment and confidence with aromatherapy massage. Additionally the medical profession 
appeared to be influential, with many respondents preferring to be referred by a GP or consultant. 
These concerns appeared to be due to lack of knowledge and awareness of aromatherapy 
massage and complementary therapies in general. Also, there appeared to exist a reliance upon 
the medical profession to be responsible for taking health care decisions. 
Kacperek L. Patients' views on the factors which would influence the use of an aromatherapy 
massage out-patient service. Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery 3(2): 51-7. Apr 1997. 
COMMENTS: This is a very interesting result indeed, in particular the willingness of patients to 
have aromatherapy massage if referred by a GP or consultant. It isn't clear whether being 
referred by a GP meant that treatment would be paid for by the NHS, in which case cost could 
well be a factor. Probably if GPs or consultants advised aromatherapy massage, this type of 
treatment would be taken more seriously as a legitimate therapeutic option. Certainly there is a 
huge potential benefit in the incorporation of such therapies into mainstream medical treatment. 
KATZ, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital, London UK writes that although nurses and 
midwives may not be involved directly in the treatment of menopausal patients, they are uniquely 
positioned to support and advise patients regarding the menopause. 
Discussion: Many women want to become informed about how to deal with symptoms and fears 
related to going through the menopause. The author states that homoeopathic treatment, which 
deals with both physical symptoms and emotional responses can be used during the menopause, 
either as an alternative to or alongside hormone replacement therapy (HRT). 
Conclusions: In addition to exploring homoeopathic approaches to the treatment of menopausal 
symptoms, the author questions the current trend of promoting HRT.

46-50. Apr 1997. 
 COMMENTS: A reminder to Positive Health readers that full transcripts of the Complementary 
Therapies for the Menopause Symposium, held 25 April 1998 are available. These publish the 
many talks and questions and answer sessions, which included types of HRT and Oestrogens,

Menopause. The price including postage (in the UK) is £7.75. 
MACKERETH, Biodynamic Massage, Reflexology and Therapeutic, Burnage, Manchester UK 
writes that he has received supervision following the completion of his biodynamic massage 
therapy training, in compliance with the requirement of the Code of Conduct for the Association of 
Holistic Biodynamic Massage Therapists. 
Discussion: The author writes of the difficulties associated with arranging supervision since most 
of the supervisors were based in London or Cambridge and not in the North West of England. 
Various types of supervision were attempted, including one-to-one supervision over the 
telephone, supported by 3-monthly meetings with a London-based supervisor. The author was 
able to obtain monthly one-to-one supervision locally four years ago and is now a member of a 
small supervision group who meet for 3 hours monthly. He more recently became a supervisor 
working with nurses working in complementary therapies and/or developing clinical supervision. 
Conclusions: The author explores the concept of supervision with the intent of sharing his 
experiences and promoting discussion within the therapeutic nursing profession.

WHITMARSH, Glasgow Homoeopathic Hospital, Scotland reported a case of migraine without 
aura, which was unresponsive to 5 years of conventional medical treatment. 
Methods and Results: Consultation with a homoeopathic physician with extensive experience in 
the diagnosis and treatment of headaches, resulted in the prescription of a single homoeopathic 
remedy which was absolutely effective for this case. 
Discussion: This report is offered as an open and retrospective study, comparing the best 
conventional migraine therapy with appropriate homoeopathic therapy in the same patient.

KELNER and WELLMAN, Institute for Human Development, Life Course and Aging, University of 
Toronto, Ontario compared the social and health characteristics of patients from five groups of 
practitioners: 1) family physicians (used as baseline group); 2) chiropractors; 3) acupuncturist/ 
traditional Chinese medicine doctors; 4) naturopaths; and 5) Reiki practitioners. 
Methods: Data were gathered in a large Canadian city during 1994-1995. Face-to-face interviews 
were carried out with 300 patients (60 patients from each treatment group). 
Results: The most evident social and health differences occurred between patients of family 
physicians and those of alternative practitioners. There were also significant differences between 
the various groups of alternative patients. Reiki patients had a higher level of education and were 
more likely to be employed in managerial or professional positions than patients from alternative 
groups. 
Conclusions: The profiles presented indicate that users of alternative therapies ought not to be 
regarded as a homogeneous population, and that almost all patients of alternative practitioners 
also consult family physicians. The emerging pattern is one of multiple uses: patients choose the 
type of practitioner they believe can best help their particular health problem.

KENNER, Department of Parent-Child Health Nursing, College of Nursing and Health University 
of Cincinnati, Ohio USA review (17 references) writes that fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are not new conditions, but are the focus of more attention from 
research conducted in these fields. The author writes that FMS and CFS are primarily women’s 
health problems and that in some instances there may be a genetic predisposition to these 
 conditions, which may have emotionally and physically devastating impacts upon sufferers’ lives. 
The treatment plan should be holistic, interdisciplinary and include alternative therapies to enable 
the client and family to be truly supported and assisted to cope with such chronic conditions.

FIELD T and colleagues, Touch Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine, 
Florida 33101, USA studied the therapeutic benefits of massage therapy or relaxation therapy for 
children with asthma.  
Methods: 32 children (16 x 4-8 years old and 16 x 9-14 years old) suffering from asthma were 
randomly assigned to either the massage or relaxation group. The parents of the children were 
taught to give one therapy or the other for 20 minutes prior to bedtime every night for 30 days.  
Results: The younger children receiving massage demonstrated an immediate decrease in 
behavioural anxiety and cortisol levels following the massage. Additionally, there was an 
improvement over the course of the study regarding their attitude toward asthma and peak air 
flow and other pulmonary functions. The older children receiving massage reported lower anxiety 
following the massage. Their attitude toward asthma also improved over the course of the study, 
but there was improvement of only one measure of pulmonary function – forced expiratory flow: 
25% to 75% improvement. The reason for the diminished therapeutic benefit in the older children 
is unknown.  
Conclusions: Daily massage improves airway calibre and control of asthma in children.

VICKERS and colleagues, Research Council for Complementary Medicine, London UK 
investigated potential research bias by analysing the results of clinical trials originating in various 
countries.  
Methods: Sources were abstracts from Medline, January 1966-June 1995. Two separate studies 
were conducted. The first comparing clinical outcome of subjects receiving acupuncture 
compared to groups receiving placebo, no treatment to a nonacupuncture intervention. The 
second study compared the results of randomised or controlled trials of interventions apart from 
acupuncture published in China, Japan, Russia/USSR or Taiwan with those published in 
England. Determination of inclusion, outcome and classification of trial by country of origin were 
performed by blinded reviewers.  
Results: 252 of 1085 abstracts of acupuncture trials met the inclusion criteria. All trials which 
originated in China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan were positive as were 10 of 11 studies 
published in Russia/USSR. In the nonacupuncture intervention studies, 405 of 1100 abstracts 
met the inclusion criteria. Compared to China (99%), Japan (89%), Russia/USSR (97%) and 
Taiwan (95%), where the results of the test treatment were superior to controls, only 75% of trials 
published in England gave the test treatment as superior to control. No trial published in China or 
Russia/USSR found a test treatment to be ineffective.  
Conclusions: Certain countries publish an unusually high proportion of positive results, which 
could be the result of publication bias. Researchers undertaking systematic reviews need to 
consider how to manage research data from these countries.

controlled trials.Control Clin Trials 19(2):159-66 April 1998. 
HILSDEN and colleagues, Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, 
Alberta, Canada studied the use of complementary therapies by patients suffering from 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 134 patients with IBD (98 Crohn’s 
disease; 34 ulcerative colitis and 2 indeterminate) by means of a mailed structured questionnaire. 
The response rate was 70%. The use of complementary medicine by the respondents was 
examined using logistic regression. The second phase of the study explored the beliefs and 
perceptions of 14 users of complementary medicine, who were interviewed.  
Results: 51% of patients had used complementary therapies during the previous 2 years. 33% of 
patients were using complementary therapies currently, and one-half of these patients were using 
complementary therapies to manage their IBD. The most commonly reported therapies were the 
use of vitamins and herbal products. Two independent predictors of complementary medicine use 
 were duration of disease greater than 10 years and history of hospitalisation. The most commonly 
cited reasons for seeking complementary medicine were side effects and lack of effectiveness of 
conventional treatment. 62% of these patients told their physicians about using complementary 
therapies.  
Conclusions: Use of complementary medicine is common in patients suffering from IBD, 
particularly among patients with a longer duration of disease or history of hospitalisation.

VERHOEF and PAGE, Department of Community Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Calgary. investigated the knowledge, opinions and referral behaviour of family 
physicians regarding massage therapy.  
Methods: The authors conducted a random, cross-sectional mailed survey of Alberta family 
practice physicians (n = 300). The survey was composed of questions regarding 
sociodemographic and practice characteristics, perceived knowledge of massage therapy, 
opinions regarding its usefulness, government regulations of massage therapy and referral 
behaviour.  
Results: 161 physicians (54%) completed the questionnaire. 68% of respondents stated they had 
minimal or no knowledge of massage therapy; however, despite this low level of knowledge, 83% 
believed that massage therapy was a useful adjunct to their own practice. In fact, 71% had 
referred patients to massage therapists and 72% perceived an increasing demand from their 
patients for massage therapy. About ½ of the physicians surveyed supported government 
regulation of massage therapy.  
Conclusions: Physicians showed a discrepancy between their knowledge of massage therapy 
and their opinions of, and referrals to, massage therapists. Those physicians who referred 
patients to massage therapists generally held more positive opinions and had greater knowledge 
of the discipline.

WONG and colleagues, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada studied how Chinese 
patients consulting family physicians in Vancouver, Canada used traditional Chinese medicine 
(TCM), in particular Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture.  
Methods: The authors conducted a bilingual (English and Chinese) survey among 4 family 
practices (932 patients or family members) with predominantly Chinese patients in Vancouver. 
The main outcome measures were demographic characteristics, frequency and reasons for 
visiting a family physician, Chinese herbalist or acupuncturist and their choice of practitioner if 
affected by one of 16 common conditions.  
Results: The study population was mainly Chinese and immigrants to Canada. 28% of 
respondents used Chinese herbal medicine, with more then one visit during the last year; 
another18% were past users of Chinese herbal medicine. 7% of respondents currently used 
acupuncture; another 8% had used acupuncture in the past. The use of Chinese herbal medicine 
varied significantly according to age, sex, immigrant status and ethnicity. Acupuncture use varied 
significantly only by age. The main reasons for consulting Chinese herbalists were infection 
(41%), respiratory problems (11%) and rheumatologic problems (10%), whereas acupuncturists 
were consulted almost exclusively for rheumatologic problems (80%).  
Conclusions: The use of TCM along with consulting family physicians was very popular among 
this predominantly Chinese study population. Patients with acute health problems, such as 
influenza, consulted both their family physicians and Chinese herbalists, often in quick 
succession. However, those patients suffering more chronic conditions, including rheumatologic 
diseases, were more likely to start using TCM following repeat visits to their family physicians.

physicians use these therapies? Can Fam Physician 44: 1009-15. May 1998. 
ANDREWS and colleagues, Faculty of Medicine, University of Adelaide, South Australia, 
Australia studied the nature and prevalence of alternative therapies used by children with asthma.  
Methods: A questionnaire describing the use of alternative therapies was completed by the 
parents of 51 children with asthma aged 1-6 years in South Australia.  
Results: About 55% of children used alternative therapies for asthma management. The therapies 
 which were most commonly used were massage, relaxation, diet and vitamin therapy. The 
authors did not find any significant difference in age, asthma severity, length of time since 
diagnosis or presence of another illness amongst children who did or did not use alternative 
therapies. 
Conclusions: A substantial proportion of children with asthma attending paediatric clinics use 
alternative therapies. Paediatricians need to be aware of this and be prepared to discuss 
alternative therapies with parents, which may facilitate a more open doctor-patient relationship 
and provide better management of the children’s asthma. 
Andrews L et al. The use of alternative therapies by children with asthma: a brief report. J 
Paediatr Child Health 34(2): 131-4 April 1998. 
Comments: It is abundantly clear from the breadth of the above reported studies, that people of 
all ages, from all over the world, suffering from a variety of health problems, are using a variety of 
alternative therapies, usually in conjunction with conventional allopathic treatment. The study by 
Vickers et al makes for worrying reading, in that it seems to be far too good to be true that 
virtually all research from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and Russia report positive results, 
whereas research from the UK reports positive results in just 75% of the cases.

VALLANCE, Medical School Registry, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK 
reviews (149 references) the evidence for the efficacy of homoeopathy. He writes that 40% of 
GPs in the Netherlands practise homoeopathy, and that with over 100 homoeopathic medical 
schools, homoeopathy is practised in India, and that in the UK, 42% of GPs refer patients to 
homoeopaths. 
Results: Two recent meta-analyses indicated that homoeopathy has added effects over those of 
placebo. However, despite this evidence there is a backdrop of considerable scientific scepticism, 
mainly due to the ultra-high dilution (UHD) of homoeopathic remedies, such that there are no 
molecules of the original substance present in the final remedy. The author suggests how the 
scientific community could respond to this challenge and writes that evidence has been 
conducted upon a diverse range of homoeopathic assays, including immunological, physiological, 
behavioural, biochemical and clinical. UHD effects has attracted the attention of physicists who 
have speculated upon their physical mechanisms. The author includes a critique of several 
experiments which formed the Benveniste affair, sparked off by the Nature article suggesting the 
existence of UHD effects of IgE upon human basophils. The author states that this is a paradigm 
example of how a controversial phenomenon can divide the scientific community and argues that 
there is as yet insufficient evidence to drive rational scientists to a consensus view regarding 
UHD effects, even if they possessed knowledge of all the evidence. Difficulty in publishing high-
quality UHD research in mainstream conventional journals precludes a fair assessment of UHD 
effects. However, given that the existence of UHD effects could revolutionise science and 
medicine, the author argues that possible UHD effects warrant serious investigation by 
conventional scientists and serious attention by scientific journals.

CARROLL and SEERS, Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics, University of Oxford, The Churchill, 
UK conducted a systematic review (54 references) of published randomised controlled trials 
regarding the effectiveness of relaxation techniques in the management of chronic pain. 
Methods: The authors searched MEDLINE, psychLITT, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain 
Relief Database. Only randomised controlled trials of relaxation techniques in chronic pain were 
included in this review. Studies investigating the effects of relaxation in combination with other 
interventions were not considered. 9 studies involving 414 patients met the predefined inclusion 
criteria and are critically appraised. Lack of quantitative data in the primary studies precluded 
meta-analysis. The studies involved patients suffering from a range of chronic pain conditions; the 
 most common pain outcome used was the McGill Pain Questionnaire. 
Results: 4 studies showed a significant difference in pain outcomes in favour of relaxation for the 
pre- and post-treatment assessments, but there were few statistically significant differences 
reported in favour of relaxation with between treatment comparisons. 3 studies reported 
statistically significant differences in favour of relaxation compared to the other treatment groups. 
For rheumatoid arthritis the McGill Pain Questionnaire scores were significantly lower for patients 
receiving relaxation compared to those in the control group. For ulcerative colitis there were 
significant differences reported in 6 out of 7 pain outcome measures in favour of progressive 
muscle relaxation compared to the waiting list control group. In one of the two cancer pain 
studies, relaxation produced significantly lower pain sensation scores compared to control 
patients. Two studies reported significant differences for the experimental control groups rather 
than for relaxation. 
Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to confirm that relaxation reduces chronic pain. Many 
studies with both positive and negative results have suffered from methodological inadequacies, 
and the authors make recommendations for future research regarding the effectiveness of 
relaxation techniques for chronic pain.

SEERS and CARROLL, Royal College of Nursing Institute, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK 
reviewed (60 references) the effectiveness of relaxation techniques used alone for management 
of acute pain following surgery and during procedures. 
Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review, searching MEDLINE, psychLITT, CINAHL, 
EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which 
yielded 7 studies involving 362 patients. 150 patients received active relaxation as the sole 
intervention. Outcome measures were pain and psychological factors. A lack of primary data 
precluded meta-analysis. 
Results: 3 of the 7 studies showed significantly less pain sensation and/or pain distress in 
patients receiving relaxation. 4 studies did not demonstrate any difference. There was weak 
evidence supporting the use of relaxation for acute pain; however, this evidence was 
inconclusive, with many of both the positive and negative studies suffering from methodological 
inadequacies. 
Conclusions: The authors state that well designed and executed randomised controlled trials are 
required before the clinical use of relaxation for acute pain management can be firmly 
underpinned by high quality research evidence. The authors further recommend that until this 
evidence is obtained, that the clinical use of relaxation for acute pain settings be carefully 
evaluated and not used as the main treatment for the management of acute pain.

GOOSSENS and colleagues, Institute for Rehabilitation Research, Hoensbroek, The 
Netherlands. M.Goossens@IRV.nl. conducted a 3-year cost-effectiveness study and compared 
the efficacy of several types of rehabilitation programmes for chronic low back pain. 
Methods: The authors compared a combined operant programme plus cognitive/relaxation 
programme with an operant programme plus attention-control. They then compared both 
programmes with a waiting-list control group and with operant rehabilitation provided by the same 
rehabilitation centre. 148 patients suffering from chronic low back pain were randomly assigned to 
the various programmes. Economic endpoints were the costs of the programme and other health 
care utilisation, costs for the patient, and the indirect costs associated with production losses due 
to low back pain.  
Results: The results of this 3-year study demonstrated that the addition of a cognitive component 
to an operant treatment did not result in significant cost differences nor improvements to quality of 
life compared to the operant treatment alone. Compared to the common individual rehabilitation 
therapy, it was concluded that the same effects can be achieved at the same or lower costs with 
a shorter, more intense standardised group programme. The operant treatment alone was more 
effective than providing no treatment in the waiting-list control group.

back pain: a randomised clinical trial. Health Econ 7(1): 39-51 Feb 1998. 
Comments: As the above studies demonstrate, there is a considerable amount of research 
focussed upon determining the efficacy of complementary therapies in many health problems, 
with the intent of proving or disproving many commonly-held assumptions such as the use of 
relaxation for pain relief, and the inclusion of a cognitive component within a back pain treatment 
programme.

McPARTLAND and SOONS, Vermont Alternative Medicine, Middlebury USA estimated the 
number of alternative/holistic practitioners in Vermont. 
Methods: The authors scanned advertisements in yellow pages, newspapers, magazines and 
brochures and performed word-of-mouth canvassing. 
Results: The authors located 897 Vermonters who derived most of their income as a practitioner 
of at least one of 97 types of alternative medicine and therapy. The majority of practitioners were 
female, and most practised more than one type of healing. The most prevalent practitioners were 
bodyworkers, followed by chiropractors, acupuncturists, herbalists and holistic psychotherapists. 
On a per-capita basis, there is 1 alternative practitioner per 652 Vermonters or 153 practitioners 
per 100,000 population. This census almost equals that of Vermont’s population of medical 
doctors (MDs). 
Conclusions: Extrapolation of this data from Vermont to a nationwide estimate suggests that there 
are over 403,000 full-time alternative practitioners practising in the United States.

prevalence, patterns of use, and national projections. J Altern Complement Med 3(4): 337-42.

Comments: These statistical projections are staggering, particularly since most of the 
practitioners are practising fairly “conventional” therapies – chiropractic, acupuncture, herbalism – 
i.e., professions fairly compatible with those of the medical profession. 
 
WIRTH and CRAM, Healing Sciences Research International, Orinda, California, USA analysed 
three studies regarding complementary healing methods. 
Methods: The series of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies concerned sEMG 
electrode placement upon specific neuromuscular paraspinal centres (cervical C4, thoracic T6 
and lumbar L3), as well as the frontalis region, as these sites correspond to chakra centres as 
described in Eastern texts. The hypothesis is that the sEMG assessment procedure had the 
potential to provide objective, quantifiable correlates for healing effects, and assess energy flow 
through the chakras during the healing treatment. 
Results: These were the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocols to evaluate 
neuromuscular paraspinal measures with differing healing interventions. Although measurement 
protocols were similar between experiments, the results varied and appeared to be linked to 
 either the meditational experience of the subjects or to the particular healer(s). These results are 
considered preliminary in nature, but they indicate a potentially objective scientific correlation to 
healing interventions. 
Conclusions: More research is required to establish the sEMG assessment procedure as a 
reliable correlative measure for healing effects and  
to determine whether consistent replicative treatment effects can be demonstrated, independent 
of the specific population or practitioner.

BLAIS and colleagues, Groupe de recherche interdisciplinaire en santé, Université de Montréal, 
Quebec Canada. blaisr@ere.umontreal.ca. compared the demographic characteristics, health 
profile and utilisation of medical services between users and non-users of alternative medicine in 
the province of Quebec, Canada. 
Methods: The authors linked respondents’ survey replies with medical service records from the 
1987 health survey. Users of alternative medicine practitioners were matched by diagnosis and 
area of residence with those who visited physician practitioners (non-users). 
Results: There were differences in age, activity, education and income between users and non-
users of alternative medicine. Following adjustments for age, education and income, both groups 
had similar health profile however users of alternative medicine had made fewer medical visits in 
the previous year. 
Conclusions: Alternative medicine attracts a particular group of people and more research is 
required in order to understand the reasons people visit alternative rather than conventional 
practitioners of medicine. 
Blais R et al. How different are users and non-users of alternative medicine? Can J Public Health 
88(3): 159-62. May-Jun 1997. 
Comments: There is a seemingly endless procession of research studies from countries all over 
the world, all directed at finding out why people wish to use non-drug, more natural treatment 
approaches, and what distinguishes these people from those who use conventional medicine. It 
seems to me quite simple and straightforward that the majority of people, given the choice, and 
being able to afford to pay for treatment, would prefer gentler therapies free from major side 
effects. Unfortunately, this is not presently an option for the majority of non-affluent people when 
most complementary treatments are not available on the NHS. However, times are changing, and 
within the next 5-10 years, therapies such as acupuncture, homoeopathy, massage, 
aromatherapy, nutritional and herbal therapy and osteopathy will become increasingly available 
through the NHS. 
 
LANGLEY and BHATTACHARYYA, Center for Pharmaceutical Economics, College of Pharmacy, 
University of Arizona, Tucson USA discuss the problem of increasing costs (and decreasing 
returns) in the treatment of patients within health care systems. 
Methods: The implications of such a situation are studied for: 1) allocation of patients to 
alternative drug therapies 2) the proportions of patients treated within the disease area to total 
patient population as a function of equilibrium conditions for maximised health care outcomes, 
given alternative assumptions regarding the existence of budget constraints upon resources 
allocated to the disease area. The authors state that the reason for considering these issues is 
that such a model and its driving assumptions are in marked contrast to those underlying the 
traditional approach to cost-effectiveness modelling. 
Results: In traditional cost-effectiveness analysis, there is an assumption that costs and 
outcomes exhibit constant returns to scale and that the process of patient selection and 
characteristics of the treating population do not need to be taken into account. This analysis 
shows that once the assumption of constant returns is abandoned, any assessment of the net 
impact of therapeutic interventions may be made only within an equilibrium, or comparative static, 
 framework subject to budget constraints in which cost functions which drive patterns of switching 
between therapies are specified. Under such conditions, the traditional, clinical-trial-based notion 
of cost-effectiveness loses all meaning.

EDWARDS, University Support Centre, University of Western Australia, Australia. 
medwards@cyllene.usa.edu.au. writes that the Zen Buddhist tradition involves a number of 
meditation and instructional techniques with strong phenomenological and theoretical 
connections with the experience of loss and the grief process. 
Results: The author utilised experiences which occurred during personal encounters with 
individuals – 3 of whom were disabled – in a grief counselling setting. There were several points 
of connections identified, including: 1) a heightened awareness of the embodied nature of 
experience 2) the importance and dialogue and relationship for healing and transformation 3) the 
focus on process as opposed to outcome 4) the importance of the process of life review 5) a 
confrontation with the nature of absence and emptiness and 6) being present to what is 
experienced rather than focusing on the need for change. The authors discusses these findings in 
terms of Ken Wilber’s full-spectrum model of human development and enlarges upon their 
implications for professional and non-professional support persons for people experiencing grief.

NORHEIM, Institute of Community Medicine, University of Tromso Norway reviews (29 
references) the adverse effects of acupuncture as recorded in papers published in journals on the 
Medline database during the period 1981-94. METHODS: There were a total of 125 papers which 
were detected by the keywords acupuncture adverse effects. The author excluded articles without 
case reports, leaving 78 reports which were reported in the present article. RESULTS: Over 14 
years, there were a total of 194 patients reported with adverse effects of acupuncture, with the 
most common mechanical organ injury attributed to pneumothorax, and hepatitis the main 
infection. Acupuncture treatment is claimed to be responsible in the death of 3 patients, one from 
bilateral pneumothorax, a second from complications from endocarditis and the third from severe 
asthma while under acupuncture treatment. The majority of adverse effects from acupuncture 
seemed to be due to insufficient basic medical knowledge, low hygienic standards and 
inadequate acupuncture education. CONCLUSIONS: This paper confirms the adverse effects of 
acupuncture under certain circumstances. However, serious adverse effects are few and 
acupuncture can generally be considered a safe treatment. 
Norheim AJ. Adverse effects of acupuncture: a study of the literature for the years 1981-1994. J 
Altern Complement Med 2(2): 291-7. Summer 1996. 
 
COMMENTS: In an ideal world, one would hope to find no reports of adverse effects from any 
 given treatment. However, we all know that we don’t live in an ideal world, and that if we consider 
any one given procedure, say giving injections, or dealing with ingrown toenails, or lancing boils, 
or even taking antibiotics, we have all heard of horror stories pertaining to reactions, infections or 
allergic drug reactions to standard medical procedures. These statistics, often representing 
hundreds or thousands of individuals, are regularly published in medical handbooks and 
occasionally in popular books or magazine articles regarding iatrogenic illness and they make 
sobering reading. Seen in this context, the fact that over a 14-year period the author was only 
able to find 125 papers representing 193 patients from all over the world reported to have 
experience adverse effects in Medline is quite astonishingly clear proof that acupuncture is 
indeed safe, provided that the practitioner is properly trained in basic medical knowledge, 
acupuncture and observe high standards of safety and hygiene. 
 
SUN, Nanjing College for Population Administrators, China studied the anti-obesity effects of 
acupuncture and influence upon water and salt metabolism. METHODS: The author studied in 75 
patients with simple obesity (12 people with oedema, 33 without oedema) the changes in 
symptoms and signs, obesity indices, blood sodium, blood potassium, and mOsm of plasma and 
urinary aldosterone prior to and following acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: The total effective 
rate of anti-obesity treatment for one month was 89.3%. Prior to acupuncture, blood sodium and 
aldosterone levels of the patients with oedema were significantly higher than in normal individuals 
or those patients with oedema however blood potassium and mOsm of plasma of the patients 
with oedema were significantly lower than normal individuals or patients without oedema. 
Following acupuncture treatment, concentrations of blood sodium and aldosterone decreased 
considerably and blood potassium and mOsm of plasma increased significantly in the patients 
with oedema. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that acupuncture treatment had not only 
a good anti-obesity effect, but that acupuncture improved water and salt metabolism of obese 
patients by regulation of nervous system and body fluid.

LEVIN, colleagues and JONAS, National Institute for Healthcare Research, Rockville MD, USA 
summarises the deliberations of the Quantitative Methods Working Group convened by the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), in support of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). 
METHODS: The working group had as its remit to identify methods of study design and data 
analysis applicable to empirical research regarding complementary and alternative medicine. This 
remit was wide-ranging and included the evaluation of alternative therapies, investigation of the 
basic science of the complementary medical systems, studies of health promotion, disease 
prevention and health services research. RESULTS: The working group produced a summary list 
of 7 recommended methodological guidelines regarding research on alternative medicine. Their 
recommendations stressed the robustness of existing research methods and analytic procedures 
despite the considerable unconventionality of alternative medicine. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast 
to the statements of researchers and practitioners of alternative medicine, established 
methodologies – experimental trials, observational epidemiology, social survey research – and 
procedures for data analysis – analysis of variance, logistic regression, multivariate modelling 
techniques – are satisfactory for addressing the majority of study issues related to alternative 
medicine, ranging from clinical research regarding therapeutic efficacy to basic scientific research 
regarding mechanisms of pathogenesis and recovery.

CARLSTON and colleagues, Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of 
California, San Francisco, USA. mcarlston@aol.com write that the use of therapies outside of 
 mainstream Western medicine, known as complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) is rapidly 
increasing in the United States. They write that despite evidence of physician interest and 
willingness to refer to CAM provides, there is presently little information regarding medical 
education in complementary practices. The authors conducted a survey to assess the frequency 
and nature of alternative medicine instruction within US medical schools and family practice 
residency programmes. METHODS: A 16-question survey was mailed to all US medical school 
family medicine department chairmen and non-university-based family practice residency 
programme directors regarding current instruction in alternative medicine, planned instruction and 
programmes being considered. RESULTS: The response rate was 78% about 30% of all 
respondents currently teaching, 6% starting to teach and 6.3% considering teaching some form of 
alternative medicine. CAM instruction was most common in the Northeast and Rocky Mountain 
regions, and is predominantly elective (72.2%), although content and teaching methods vary 
widely. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative medicine is starting to establish a presence in US medical 
schools and family practice residency programmes, with subjects varying widely in content and 
format.

HE and colleagues, Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway, studied the 
effects of acupuncture upon smoking reduction and cessation. METHODS: 46 healthy men and 
women, of mean age of 39 years, smoking 20 +/- 6 cigarettes daily over a period of 23 +/- 8 years 
and who wished to cease smoking participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned 
to two groups as follows: 1) Group I received acupuncture treatment at points used for anti-
smoking (test group TG) 2) Group II received acupuncture treatment at points assumed to have 
no effect for smoking cessation (control group CG). Each participant replied to questionnaires 
regarding his or her smoking habits and attitudes prior to each treatment and following the last 
treatment. Concentrations of cotinine, thiocyanate, peroxides and fibrinogen were measured prior 
to the first and following the last acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: Daily cigarette consumption 
declined during the treatment period in both groups however the reduction was larger for TG than 
for CG. 31% of those in TG had ceased smoking compared with none in CG. In TG 
concentrations of cotinine and thiocyanate were significantly reduced following the treatment 
period, compared to the no significant reductions in CG group. The taste of tobacco worsened 
during the treatment period in both groups, but the effect was more pronounced for TG than CG. 
Desire to smoke fell significantly in both groups following treatment the reduction was larger for 
TG than CG. There were no significant changes in concentrations of peroxides and fibrinogen 
during the treatment period for either group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggests 
that acupuncture may help to motivate smokers to reduce or quit smoking. Different acupoints 
appear to have different effects for smoking cessation and reduction.

ERNST and PITTLER, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, 
University of Exeter, Exeter UK conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the 
effectiveness of acupuncture for dental pain. METHODS: Computerised literature searches were 
performed of Medline, Embase, CISCOM and Cochrane Library databases additionally, experts 
were solicited to contribute their own published and unpublished material. All studies were 
evaluated and rated according to a standardised criteria with particular attention to the 
methodological quality (Jadad score) of the research performed. RESULTS: 16 trials, mostly 
using acupuncture in a clinical situation, predominantly for pain relief during dental procedures, 
were assessed. The majority of these investigations suggested that acupuncture is more effective 
than control treatment only 4 trials implied the contrary. All the experimental studies were 
positive. Of the more recent 11 trials which were randomised, only 4 were negative. In 8 
randomised trials, in which there was present some degree of blinding, only 1 was negative. In 
the 7 studies which were sham controlled in addition to being blinded and randomised, all but 1 
were positive. In one of the studies with the highest Jadad score, with 40 volunteers receiving ear 
or sham acupuncture, the real acupuncture group experienced an 18% increase in their pain 
 threshold to experimental pain. In another study with a high Jadad score, in which 
electroacupuncture or sham was used while drilling, a remarkable placebo-response of 100% of 
patients resulted, with no differences between the acupuncture and sham groups. 
CONCLUSIONS: These data from these studies suggest that acupuncture is effective for pain 
relief for dental operations following surgery or during experimentally induced dental pain. The 
mechanisms for this may relate to the blocking afferent pathways, effects upon endogenous 
opioids and inhibitory effects upon efferent pathways. The methodological details and 
heterogeneity across this literature limits the conclusions which can be made. Further research 
should consider optimal acupuncture technique and acupuncture’s relative efficacy compared to 
conventional pain relief methods.

COMMENTS: It was not very long ago that certain respected authorities were disputing and even 
ridiculing the notions of acupuncture meridians and the clinical efficacy of acupuncture. Regular 
readers of this research section will be familiar with the considerable volume of research, mainly 
emanating from China, regarding the application of acupuncture for many important diseases, 
including stroke, hypertension, diabetes, emesis and pain relief. The mechanisms for 
acupuncture’s efficacy are being researched in earnest, so that before long, we may be 
understand why acupuncture works, which may help to convince extreme doubters who can not 
believe anything unless a rational explanation is advanced.

BERDEN and colleagues, BION, Institute for Bioelectromagnetics and New Biology, Ljubljana, 
Slovenia studied whether electromagnetic field emission from living beings could modify physical 
characteristics of water. METHODS: The authors followed three types of experiments: 1) Whether 
and in which way water exposed to growing and dying spruce seedlings through a quartz test 
tube, and hence with no chemical contact, influences germination of seeds and growth of 
seedlings of the same species 2) Whether and in which way distilled water equally exposed to 
growing and dying spruce seedlings and various stages of mealworm beetle can be modified, 
with this modification later reproduced via a specially developed technique of electrophotography 
3) Whether an emission from human hands can modify, non-chemically, the physical 
characteristics of distilled water. RESULTS: Statistical analyses demonstrated two different 
groups of people: 1) those capable of imprinting some form of highly reproducible radiation into 
water, and 2) others at most capable of imprinting only some type of highly variable radiation. 
CONCLUSIONS: This line of research could provide a scientifically based testing of actual 
capabilities of so-called biotherapists performing unconventional healing. These experiments also 
demonstrate further indirect evidence for a form of electromagnetic emission from living beings 
and that such emission alters water in an as yet unknown way. 
Berden M et al. A possible physical basis for the healing touch (biotherapy) evaluated by high 
voltage electrophotography. Acupunct Electrother Res 22(2): 127-46. 1997. 
COMMENTS: The quest to find and prove the existence of electromagnetic emissions from living 
beings is one of the central tenets (holy grail) of healing and energy-based medicine. The ability 
of highly dilute substances to imprint or somehow alter water is of course at the centre of the 
controversy regarding the efficacy of homoeopathy. These questions will not go away soon. 
WATSON and WATSON, University of Bradford, review the therapeutic benefits of massage and 
its relationship and relevant to orthodox therapies. RESULTS: The majority of studies regarding 
the effects of massage upon patients' wellbeing have been conducted by non-nursing 
researchers. The authors suggest that nurse-based research would make an important 
contribution to holistic care approach. The write that interest in and use of complementary 
therapies has grown over recent years and that massage appears to be of particular interest to 
nurses, as it involves close, intimate, contact in which nurses are often engaged as part of their 
daily work with patients. The benefits and problems associated with massage are explored.

BUSS and colleagues, Maastricht University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Nursing 
Science, The Netherlands write that the prevention of pressure sores is a major concern of 
rehabilitation nurses. BACKGROUND: Over the years, a number of methods have been used to 
prevent pressure sores. One of the most commonly used methods is massage of bony 
prominences and pressure areas. However, according to the majority of contemporary clinical 
guidelines, massage is to be avoided. The authors review (30 references) through a search of the 
literature, the extent to which such guidelines are based upon research findings regarding the 
effectiveness of massage in preventing pressure sores. RESULTS: The results of the studies 
analysed led the authors to the conclusion that massage as therapy for preventing pressure sores 
in patients at risk is not recommended.

LINDE and colleagues, Munchener Modell, Centre for Complementary Medicine Research, 
Technische Universitat/Ludwig-Maximillans-Universitat, Munchen, Germany write that 
homoeopathy appears to be scientifically implausible but is widely used. The authors assessed 
the clinical effect reported in randomised controlled trials of homoeopathic remedies compared to 
placebo. METHODS: The literature search included studies from computerised bibliographies, 
contracts with researchers, institutions, manufacturers, individual collectors, conference 
proceedings and books in all languages, double blind and/or randomised placebo-controlled 
trials. From 185 trials identified, 119 met the inclusion criteria and 89 had data adequate for meta-
analysis. Study quality was assessed by two reviewers with two scales and extracted data for 
clinical outcome, homoeopathy type, dilution, “remedy” population and outcomes. RESULTS: The 
combined odds ratio for the 89 studies entered into the main meta-analysis was 2.45 in favour of 
homoeopathy. The odds ratio for the 26 good quality studies was 1.66 and, following correction 
for publication bias was 1.78. 4 studies regarding the effects of a single remedy upon seasonal 
allergies had a pooled odds ratio for eye symptoms at 4 weeks of 2.03. CONCLUSIONS and 
DISCUSSION: The results from this meta-analysis are not compatible with the hypothesis that 
clinical effects of homoeopathy are completely due to placebo. [Editor’s note: How is that for a 
negative way of phrasing essentially a positive result?] However there was insufficient evidence 
to show that homoeopathy was clearly efficacious for any single clinical condition. Further 
research regarding homoeopathy is justified provided that it is rigorously and systematically 
conducted.

WHITE, RESCH and ERNST, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical 
School, University of Exeter UK write that information regarding GPs’ use of and attitudes toward 
Complementary Medicine (CM) is necessary in order to progress the debate about the role of CM 
within mainstream medicine. Evidence shows that the use of CM is particularly high in the South-
West of the UK. METHODS: A survey of all primary care physicians working in the health service 
in Devon and Cornwall was carried out via a questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 981 GPs contacted, 
461, or 47% replied to the questionnaire. 316 GPs (68%) had been involved with CM in some 
way during the previous week. At least one form of CM was practised by 74 (16%) of the 
respondents, the two most common being homoeopathy (5.9%) and acupuncture (4.3%). 115 
(25%) had referred at least one patient to a complementary therapist in the previous week and 
253 (55%) had endorsed or recommended CM treatment. The three most effective therapies 
rated by the GPs were chiropractic, acupuncture and osteopathy and a majority of the 
respondents thought that these three therapies ought to be funded by the health service. 176 
(38%) of respondents reported adverse effects, the most common following manipulation. 
 CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds of GPs in Devon and Cornwall, higher than the national 
average, who replied to this questionnaire had been involved with complementary medicine in 
some way during the previous week. The majority of GP respondents thought that acupuncture, 
chiropractic and osteopathy were effective therapies and should be funded by the NHS.

COMMENTS: Without wishing to dampen down these extremely promising figures of GPs 
embracing complementary medicine, it must be pedantically pointed out that merely 47% of the 
GPs contacted replied to the questionnaire. If the percentage of use of complementary therapies 
by GPs is the same for the remaining 53% of GPs who didn’t respond, then we have the glowing 
situation whereby two thirds of GPs support at least the more mainstream therapies of 
complementary medicine. However, if the worst case scenario exists whereby none of these 520 
other GPs endorse or use complementary medicine, then the percentage drops to 316 out of 981, 
or roughly one third. Probably the real figure is somewhere between one and two thirds, or one 
half, which is still a milestone achievement. 
 
ALKHAWAJAH, Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, King Faisal University, 
Dammam, Saudi Arabia writes that Juglans regia L. bark is used as a toothbrush and a cosmetic 
lip colourant dye in some countries. RESULTS: This bark extract showed a broad spectrum 
antimicrobial activity in a dose-dependent manner, inhibiting the growth of several pathogenic 
micro-organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, gram-positive 
bacteria, and Esherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gram-negative bacteria and the 
yeast Candida albicans. The bark extract had either synergistic or additive anti-microbial action 
when used with a wide range of antibacterial drugs. Its action also increased saliva pH. 
CONCLUSIONS: Brushing the teeth with this bark may help to improve oral hygiene, prevent 
plaque, cavity formation and reduce gingival and periodontal infections.

80. 1997. 
 
COMMENTS: As the above two studies illustrate, there is a significant research effort 
internationally devoted to detecting antimicrobial and antifungal activity among herbal and plant 
materials. In view of the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance to the widespread use of 
antibiotics, this type of research and these results will gain in importance as time progresses. 
 
HOU and LI, Xinjiang Academy of Forestry Science, China have previously shown that plants 
exhibit functional characteristics similar to the meridian system in humans and animals, including 
high potential and low electrical resistance, high temperature and spontaneous sound production. 
In this paper the authors show the effect of acupuncture on plants. METHODS: 2 cultivars of 
Phaseolus vulgaris (pole bean and bush bean) were subjected to acupuncture by the insertion of 
2 needles into opposite sides of the stem of the unifoliolate buds. RESULTS: Acupuncture 
strengthened the growth and development of the plants. Two repeated experiments 
demonstrated that, compared to the control plants under the same growing conditions, the mean 
net photosynthesis rate of the acupuncture-treated plants increased by about 20.5%, mean 
transpiration by 27.2%, growth, total internodal length by 22.5%, and total dry weight of shoots 
from the cotyledon to the apex by 22.9%. Additionally acupuncture-treated plants flowered 3 days 
earlier and produced 14.4% more fruit than untreated control plants. CONCLUSIONS: 
Acupuncture may become a viable technique for increasing agricultural yield of crop plants.

COMMENTS: What astonishing research results, which, in addition to adding to the evidence of 
the existence of acupuncture meridians, also shows that acupuncture increases agricultural 
productivity in food crops such as beans!

MILLAR, Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada, Ottawa. millway@statcan.ca. studied the 
use of alternative health care practitioners by Canadians aged 15 and over. METHODS: Data 
from 17,626 respondents from the 1994-95 National Population Health Survey were selected. 
Consultation with an alternative health care practitioner or chiropractor was considered to be an 
indicator of use of alternative health care. RESULTS: In 1994-95, some 15% of Canadians aged 
15 and above (3.3 million people) used some form of alternative health care in the year preceding 
the survey. The most prevalent users of alternative health care were women, people aged 45-64 
and among higher income groups. Use of alternative health care was associated with the number 
of diagnosed chronic illnesses. In people free of chronic diseases, 9% visited alternative 
practitioners, compared with 26% who had three or more chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: 
The projected demand for services from alternative practitioners will rise as the population ages 
and the proportion of people with multiple chronic illness increases. Inclusion of alternative 
practitioner services under existing health care plans could result in higher health care costs. 
Millar WJ. Use of alternative health care practitioners by Canadians. Can J Public Health 88(3): 
154-8. May-Jun 1997. 
COMMENTS: The whole idea of much of alternative and complementary therapies is that these 
therapies, by and large, are much less expensive than many high-tech treatments and may also 
help to actually treat chronic illnesses which are refractive to conventional medical approaches. 
For example, treatment of arthritis or back pain with dietary measures or bodywork procedures 
costs less than expensive cortisone or gold injections or surgery and also less likely to cause 
serious side effects, if at all. Perhaps these researchers ought to think again at their conclusions 
above! 
MAA and colleagues, School of Nursing, Chang Gung College of Medicine and Technology, 
Taiwan, Republic of China write that acupressure, a therapy in which gentle pressure is applied 
with fingers at specific acupoints on the body, has been reported to relieve pain and to have other 
therapeutic effects. The authors investigated the value of self-administered acupressure as an 
adjunct to a pulmonary rehabilitation programme (PRP) for the relief of dyspnea and other 
symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: 31 new 
patients beginning a 12-week PRP were randomly assigned to one of two groups in a single-blind 
pretest-posttest cross-over study. Group 1 patients were taught acupressure and practised 
acupressure daily at home for 6 weeks, then used sham acupressure for the following 6 weeks. In 
group 2, the order of acupressure and sham acupressure was reversed. Throughout weeks 1, 6 
and 12, patient dyspnea, symptoms associated with COPD, activity tolerance, lung function and 
functional exercise capacity were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with sham acupressure, real 
acupressure was more effective in reducing dyspnea and was minimally effective for the relief of 
decathexis. Sham acupressure appeared to be more effective for reducing peripheral sensory 
symptoms, but the presence of these symptoms may also be an indication that the acupressure is 
affecting the body. CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure appears to be useful to patients with COPD as 
an adjunct to a PRP in reducing dyspnea. People not familiar with traditional Chinese medicine 
can learn and will accept self-administered acupressure as part of their self-care.

SUDAN reports that extremely low frequencies ranging from 1-1.Hz, imprinted in water (imprinting 
was performed by succussing a glass containing the water) resulted in the total abrogation 
(disappearance) of a facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. This has been proposed as a visible model for 
the theory of "memory of water". This technique provides a new perspective regarding the enigma 
of homoeopathy and the treatment of allergic diseases and possibly other inflammatory reactions.

massage. The review provides a critique of the methodology used in these studies and of the 
issues relating to the research design, samples, measurement tools, analysis and the massage 
intervention, highlighting several key issues regarding the design of the studies and including 
recommendations for future research studies evaluating massage.

FRYBACK and REINERT, Indiana University, USA write that people coping with AIDS and cancer 
have a sense of being out of control in dealing with their illness. Much of this feeling stems from 
the uncertainty regarding the accepted medical treatment for their disease. METHODS: The 
authors conducted a research study to evaluate attitudes towards dealing with AIDS and cancer. 
RESULTS: Respondents in the naturalistic research study were adamant in their belief that 
alternative therapies assisted to regain control over their care and therefore, enhanced their 
health. It is critically important that clinical nurse specialists who often act as consultants to other 
nurses, understand and support the therapeutic choices of their patients. Additionally, in light of 
the evidence supporting the benefit of stress reduction upon length of survival, advanced practice 
nurses can play a major role in helping patients to reduce stress and enhance quality of life and 
hopefully longevity.

CASTOT and colleagues, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance Hopital Fernand Widal, Paris, 
France write that for several years, herbal medicines have been consumed increasingly by 
patients without prescription. Traditionally herbal medicines are innocuous; however as medicinal 
products they require drug surveillance in order to identify any risks. A primary concern is to 
confer upon them legal status, in order to evaluate their efficacy and control their safety. 
Published research indicates that the risk is usually due either to a contaminant, an added drug or 
falsification. The Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres have received, since 1985, 341 reports of 
undesirable effects attributed to herbal medicines. Included were 30 cases of hepatitis associated 
with germander which has now been withdrawn from the French market. This illustrates the role 
for the national system and its responsibility for collecting and evaluating adverse drug reactions 
due to herbal medicines.

TAUBERT, Praxis fur Physikalische und Rehabilitative Medizin, Neubrandenburg, Germany 
writes that during times of limited funds for health care, it seems sensible to critically evaluate 
commonly used therapeutic techniques. The author writes that it is frequently demanded within 
this context to remove massage from the tariff catalogue of health insurances. METHODS: 
Therefore, the author attempted to assess massage on grounds of results to mechanisms of 
action, indications and contraindications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite certain reservations, this 
successful method, namely massage, should keep its place by using calculated prescription 
within complex treatment programmes.

ERNST and WHITE, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, 
University of Exeter UK write that although laboratory studies demonstrate that acupuncture may 
produce physiological effects, clinical studies of acupuncture are often inconclusive. The authors 
assert that randomised controlled trials are the best way to test for the specific therapeutic 
effectiveness of a particular treatment modality. Difficulties in clinical acupuncture research 
include: diversity of forms of therapy; individualised treatments; binding; choosing a credible 
control procedure; selection of suitable endpoints; and traditional diagnosis. Furthermore, 
enthusiasm of acupuncture proponents may bias the research they are performing. 
CONCLUSIONS: The authors state that none of these difficulties is insurmountable. They list 
examples of rigorous trials and offer suggestions in order to improve acupuncture research.

COMMENTS: As Complementary therapies become more widespread and accepted as effective 
and safe means of treatment, so will each therapy – massage, acupuncture, herbal medicine – 
become subjected to a greater degree to rigorous and critical evaluation. These evaluations and 
examinations will, in the end, greatly benefit the safe and effective practice of these therapies 
which will ultimately help patients treated.

SCHENK and colleagues, Department of Family medicine, Wayne State University School of 
Medicine, Detroit, Michigan USA write that although The Institute of Medicine has recommended 
basic clinical competence in Environmental Medicine (EM) for all physicians, the amount and 
content of such instruction in EM currently offered in US medical schools in unknown. 
METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study based upon responses to a 
questionnaire, mailed in June 1994 concerning the EM curriculum content in US medical schools, 
in Association of American Medical colleges curriculum survey. RESULTS: 119 out of 126 
schools (94%) responded. Of these 29 (24%) reported no required EM curriculum content. Those 
schools with EM content averaged 7 hours of instruction. 81 schools (68%) had faculty with 
environmental and occupational medicine expertise, primarily within departments of medicine, 
preventive, and family medicine. CONCLUSIONS: In order for medical students to acquire the 
knowledge and skills to prevent, diagnose and treat health problems with an environmental 
exposure component, there is a need for increased EM instruction within medical school 
curricula. In those schools with EM content in their curriculum, the required expertise to develop 
EM curriculum may be available within existing faculty.

499-501. May 1996. 
COMMENTS: I sincerely hope that the Institute of Medicine also decrees in the very near future 
that physicians ought to acquire clinical competence in Nutritional Medicine, a vitally important 
subject which is similarly not provided for in medical school curricula in the USA nor in the UK. 
XU and colleagues, Office of Research, Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Athens 
45701 USA studied the differences between osteopathic and allopathic physicians regarding 
factors which influenced their career choice of family practice. METHODS: Surveyed were 256 
osteopathic and 717 allopathic family physicians, who had graduated in 1983 and 1984. 
Comparisons were made on 19 variables which influenced physicians’ decision to enter family 
practice and on the six factor scores derived these 19 variables. RESULTS: Osteopathic 
physicians’ decisions to choose family practice was more influenced by financial obligations, 
medical school experiences and family values, whereas allopathic physicians were more 
influenced by personal social value. Overall, medical school experience and personal social value 
were the two important factors explaining the largest variances of the 19 predictors influencing 
physicians’ decisions to enter family practice. Allopathic medical schools whose mission 
emphasises production of generalist physicians may be able to model approaches already in 
place in osteopathic medical schools. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the large influence of the 
personal social value factor in medical students’ choice to enter family practice medicine, this 
factor warrants further study.

DOXEY and PHILLIPS, Los Angeles College of Chiropractic, Whittier, California 90609-1166 
USA compared US chiropractic college admissions requirements with those of allopathic, 
osteopathic, optometry, podiatry and dentistry. METHODS: Participants in the survey included 16 
chiropractic, 17 allopathic, 16 osteopathic, 16 optometric, 7 podiatric and 15 dental colleges. Data 
collected from the individual schools included: 1) minimum number of undergraduate semester 
hours toward a bachelor’s degree required on entrance; 2) actual percentage of applicants with a 
4-year bachelor’s degree on entrance; 3) minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) required on 
 entrance; and 4) actual average GPA of applicants on entrance. RESULTS: Overall, allopathic 
averages were highest and chiropractic averages lowest for each of the four outcome measures, 
with the other disciplines scoring varying points in between. CONCLUSIONS: The successful 
completion of preprofessional requirements may provide an indicator for success within a 
rigorous professional curriculum. These results reflect overall differences between health-care 
professions based upon several entrance criteria. Further study is required to understand the 
long-term consequences of these differences, as well as any economic and/or political factors 
which may be contributing to these data. 
Doxey TT and Phillips RB. Comparison of entrance requirements for health care professions. J 
Manipulative Physiol Ther 20(2): 86-91. Feb 1997. 
COMMENTS: Stripped of any interpretation, these results starkly show that among the 5 
professions surveyed – allopathic medicine, osteopathy, optometry, podiatry, dentistry, and 
chiropractic – those students with the highest education and highest grades chose to enter 
allopathic medical schools and those with the least education and lowest grades (among the 5 
types of colleges) chose chiropractic college. Not having seen the actual data, but only the 
abstract, we are not informed of the degree of difference separating these professions, nor of the 
order between highest to lowest. This information is of course absolutely necessary prior to 
making any further comments; however, common sense alone would advise that factors such as 
prestige, income potential and professional advancement within the USA would certainly be major 
factors in the motivation of the finest students to become allopathic physicians.

LAWSON and CALDERON, Institute for Biomedical Engineering and Rehabilitation Services, 
Touro College, Dix Hills, NY 11746, USA conducted two trials testing the inter examiner reliability 
of Applied Kinesiology manual testing. METHODS: In the first trial, 3 practitioners, each with more 
then 10 years' experience using muscle testing, tested 32 healthy people in order to compare 
their agreement regarding the strength or weakness of right and left piriformis and right and left 
hamstring muscles. The second study had the same 3 examiners test 53 individuals for strength 
or weakness of pectoralis and tensor fascia lata muscles bilaterally. RESULTS: In the first trial, 
although there was significant agreement between examiners for piriformis muscles, little 
agreement was found with the hamstring muscles. In the second trial, significant agreement 
occurred with pectoralis muscles, but not with the tensor fascia lata muscles. 
Lawson A and Calderon L. Inter examiner agreement for applied kinesiology manual muscle 
testing. Percept Mot Skills 84(2): 539-46. Apr 1997. 
COMMENTS: Reproducibility and reliability in muscle testing has always been a subject of 
vigorous debate and this issue needs to be resolved urgently, in light of the large number of 
practitioners who use muscle testing as a diagnostic tool.  
PARAMORE, Project Hope Center for Health Affairs, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA conducted 
a study to update national estimates regarding the use of alternative therapies, in order to 
improve the quality of the estimates and to investigate differences between users and nonusers 
of alternative medicine. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 1994 Robert Wood Johnson 
Foundation National Access to Care Survey. RESULTS: Almost 10% of the US population, about 
25 million people, visited a professional in 1994 for at least one of the following four therapies: 
chiropractic, relaxation techniques, therapeutic massage or acupuncture. Alternative therapy 
users made almost twice as many visits to conventional practitioners compared to nonusers, 
users still reported much higher levels of unmet need for medical care. CONCLUSIONS: The 
growing emphasis upon market-driven health care and consumer choice suggests that alternative 
therapies may have a larger role in the health-care system for the future.

SOLLNER and colleagues, Department of Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Leopold 
Franzens University, Innsbruck Austria. wolfgang.soellner@uibk.ac.at. studied melanoma 
patients' attitude toward alternative therapies, compliance with conventional treatment, social 
 support received and their coping strategies with their illness. METHODS: Out of 236 consecutive 
patients in a University hospital melanoma clinic serving the Tyrol region, 215 participated in the 
study. Patients completed questionnaires regarding their interest in alternative therapies, their 
distress and social support and coping skills. RESULTS: 117 patients (54.4%) expressed an 
interest in nonconventional therapy and 30 patients (14%) actually used such methods, those 
patients more often suffering from advanced cancer. Compared with the disinterested patients, 
those patients interested in alternative therapy were younger, showed a more active coping style 
and tendencies toward religiousness and search for personal meaning in their disease. These 
patients' confidence in conventional medicine and compliance with suggestions from their 
physicians were not less than of the uninterested patients, but they believed that they received 
less emotional support from their physicians and expressed interest in receiving much more 
support. CONCLUSIONS: Melanoma patients consider non-conventional therapies to be 
supplementary to conventional medical treatment and as a strategy of avoiding passivity and 
coping with feelings of hopelessness. This does not diminish the need to educate patients 
regarding the lack of efficacy of unorthodox methods but stresses the importance of offering them 
adequate emotional support. 
Sollner W et al. Attitude toward alternative therapy, compliance with standard treatment, and 
need for emotional support in patients with melanoma. Arch Dermatol 133(3): 316-21. March

COMMENTS: Excuse me Messrs Sollner et al, but how is it that you already know that 
unorthodox medical methods lack efficacy in the treatment of melanoma and hence you feel 
obliged to educate your patients of such a fact? How successful are conventional medical 
treatments, and were not the conventional medical treatments of today the unconventional or 
radical experimental treatments of yesterday or last year? There is a considerable published 
medical literature regarding inhibitory and preventive effects of a number of nutrients upon 
melanoma, including Vitamins A, C and E, beta-carotene, selenium and omega-3 and -6 fatty 
acids. These results will eventually lead to "conventional" treatments with these dietary 
supplements.

RAMPES and colleagues, Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital NHS Trust, London UK 
surveyed deans of British medical school to assess provision for complementary medicine in the 
curriculum for undergraduate medical students. The authors also questioned medical students at 
one medical school regarding their knowledge of and views on instruction in complementary 
medicine. RESULTS: Although there is little education in complementary medicine at British 
medical schools, this is an area of active curriculum development. Levels of knowledge vary 
widely between different therapies. The majority of medical students want to learn about 
acupuncture, hypnosis, homoeopathy and osteopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary 
medicine instruction ought to be included in the medical undergraduate curriculum. This could be 
achieved without a great increase in the teaching of facts, which could serve as a vehicle to 
introduce broader issues, as recommended by the General Medical Council.

KAINZ and colleagues, Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria write that despite 
the wide practical application of homoeopathy, scientifically credible placebo-controlled studies 
are scarce. The authors evaluated the efficacy of homoeopathy for the treatment of warts on 
children in a prospective, double-blind randomised trial. METHODS: Participating were 60 
children aged 6-12 years with common warts on the back of the hands, who were treated either 
with an individually selected homoeopathic preparation (n=30) of at least a 1:1, 012 dilution or 
given a pure placebo in the form of saccharose (n=30) under double-blind conditions. The area 
occupied by the warts was measured prior to and following 8 weeks of treatment. Reduction of 
the wart area by at least 50% was considered to constitute a response. RESULTS: A total of 16 
children responded - 9 of 30 children in the homoeopathy group and 7 of 30 children in the 
 placebo group. A total cure of warts occurred in 5 children in the homoeopathy group and in 1 
child in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no apparent difference between 
homoeopathic and placebo treatment in children with common warts in this study.

ELDER and colleagues, Department of Family Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, 
Portland USA eldern@OHSU.edu write that in recent years, the use of alternative medicine has 
become more acknowledged in the United States. Many different therapeutic practices are 
encompassed by the terms alternative, unorthodox and complementary medicine and their use by 
the population is now being defined. Also, the number of established family practice patients 
using alternative medicine is not known. METHODS: The authors conducted a survey of patients 
from 4 family practices from a large community in the western United States regarding their use 
of alternative medicine. Participants attended a focus group to discuss more fully their use of 
alternative medicine. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 113 family practice patients, 
of whom fifty percent (57/113) had or were using some form of alternative medicine. However, 
only 53% (30/57) had told their family physician about using alternative medicine. There were no 
significant attributions to gender, educational level, age, race or clinic attended. The main reason 
for using alternative medicine was the belief that it would work. Many patients who worked in 
combination with a family physician mentioned acceptance and control, but those patients who 
did not work with their physician mentioned traditional medicine's limitations and narrow-
mindedness. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians need to be aware that many of their patients 
may be using alternative health care. Open and nonjudgmental questioning of patients may help 
to increase physician knowledge of this use, which may lead to improved patient care and the 
working together of physicians and patients.

PRACTICE AND POLICY GUIDELINES PANEL, National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative 
Medicine (NIHOAM) estimate that 1 out of every 3 Americans uses some form of complementary 
and alternative medicine (CAM) such as acupuncture, homoeopathy and herbal medicine. The 
NIHOAM convened in 1995 an expert panel to examine the role of clinical practice guidelines in 
CAM. RESULTS: The panel concluded that CAM practices are currently unsuitable for the 
development of evidence-based practice guidelines, partly due to lack of relevant outcomes data 
from well-designed clinical trials. Moreover there are challenging methodological problems when 
notions of standardisation and appropriateness are applied to CAM, which uses many different 
treatment practices and encourages highly individualised care. CAM disciplines have 
fundamental differences, which are even more striking when compared with those used by 
Western medicine, in how target conditions are defined, causes of disease, interventions and 
outcome measures of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The panel made a series of 
recommendations regarding strategies to strengthen the evidence base for future guideline 
development in CAM and to better meet the current information needs of clinicians, patients and 
guideline developers seeking information regarding CAM treatments.

CROCETTI and colleagues, UO Epidemiologia, CSPO USL 10, Firenze, Italy write that 
complementary medicine (CM) is widely used by cancer patients. The authors conducted a study 
to evaluate the knowledge of and the attitude towards CM amongst Italian allopathic oncologists. 
METHODS: 76 oncologists from Genoa, 80 oncologists from Naples and 100 hospital 
practitioners from the Province of Sondrio replied to a self-administered structured questionnaire 
regarding CM, including their knowledge and opinion of CM and CM therapists, their sources of 
information, use of CM for themselves, practice of CM and attitude to refer patients to CM. 
RESULTS: 190 oncologists replied; the response from Naples oncologists was significantly lower. 
Twenty percent of the physicians replied that they had no knowledge of CM. Main sources of 
information were newspapers and TV. Twenty-five percent of physicians had personally used CM 
and about twenty-five percent had practised a kind of CM. the percentage of oncologists from 
Genoa who referred their cancer patients to CM was significantly higher than from the other 
 groups. The physicians thought that about 84% of their patients used CM. Oncologists from 
Genoa referred patients to CM at a significantly higher rate. Oncologists who had personally used 
CM referred patients to CM 3 times more frequently than others. CONCLUSIONS: According to 
their physicians, a large percentage of cancer patients used CM. The oncologists' level and 
quality of knowledge of CM was low. Oncologists could hardly be helpful for their patients in 
dealing with therapies different from conventional medicine. 
Crocetti E et al. Complementary medicine and oncologists' attitudes: a survey in Italy. Tumori 
82(6): 539-42. Nov-Dec 1996. 
COMMENTS: It is obvious that the use of complementary medicine among the public has 
burgeoned. The reaction from the medical profession seems to fall into several categories: 1) 
Find out why people want to use complementary medicine and make certain that people tell their 
physicians that they are using complementary medicine; 2) Learn about complementary therapies 
from the newspapers and TV; 3) Actually study and practise complementary therapies; 4) Refer 
patients to complementary practitioners. It is appalling that a fifth of the Italian oncologists 
surveyed above had absolutely no knowledge of complementary medicine, despite their estimate 
that about 85% of cancer patients use these therapies. The preferred answer must lie in the 
setting of standards for complementary therapies, and the gradual introduction of these 
disciplines into the medical school curriculum, so that future generations of physicians are not 
ignorant of complementary medicine.

MELCHART and colleagues, Projekt Munchener Modell, Technische Universitat, Munich, 
Germany write that a scientific evaluation of complementary medical practices being used in 
healthcare is urgently required. They state that although randomised clinical trials are the primary 
tools used for such evaluation, they need not be the only tool. The authors propose that 
systematic clinical auditing could: 1) provide information regarding the “epidemiology” of 
complementary medical practices; 2) make more clearly intelligible the processes used in the 
daily practice of complementary methods; and 3) provide a preliminary estimation of outcomes. 
Systematic clinical auditing uses mainly observational studies of large cohorts of patients. 
METHODS: The authors conducted a pilot study to study the feasibility of using a systematic 
clinical audit for traditional Chinese medicine. 1597 patients admitted to the hospistal between 
February 1 1992 and August 31 1993 were included in the study. The patients’ characteristics, 
diagnoses and preventive and therapeutic treatments were recorded and patients rated the 
intensity of their main complaints upon admission, at discharge and at 2, 6 and 12 months after 
admission. About two thirds of the patients had chronic pain complaints, the most common 
diagnosis being migraine (n=224). Most patients received acupuncture and Chinese herbal 
therapy, 61% received tuina massage and 16% received qigong. The mean intensity of main 
complaints was 7.0 upon admission, 4.6 at discharge and 5.5, 12 months after admission. 
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic clinical auditing is a valuable tool for collecting basic information 
regarding structural characteristics, processes, and outcomes regarding complementary medicine 
and for the determination of representative and relevant questions for future randomised clinical 
trials.

DIMMOCK and colleagues, Clinical Pharmacology Unit (Rheumatism Research) Unversity of 
Leeds, United Kingdom examined the factors influencing the use of complementary therapies in 
patients suffering with fibromyalgia. METHODS: 90 patients who had attended a rheumatology 
out-patients clinic in West Yorkshire for their diagnosis or treatment of fibromyalgia were sent a 
postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 71% of patients with fibromyalgia had used or were using 
complementary therapies, the most popular therapy being oral supplementation. Those using 
complementary therapies were from a higher socio-economic group. The duration of treatment 
with complementary therapies ranged from 3 months to 26 years (median = 3) and the number of 
therapies used by each patient ranged from 1 to 10. There was an association between the 
 duration of fibromyalia and the duration of complementary therapies and the number of therapies 
used. The most frequent source of advice (40%) for the decision to use complementary therapies 
was from a magazine. Patients using complementary therapies were less likely to be satisfied 
with their current hospital treatment and decided to try complementary therapy in order to gain 
relief from the symptoms of their fibromyalgia. The authors surmised that the relatively high cost 
and lack of information regarding complementary therapies apparently dissuaded those patients 
(29%) who did not use them.

fibromyalgia. Clin Rheumatol. 15(5): 478-82. Sep 1996.  
COMMENTS: It is fairly obvious from the language used in the title and throughout the article that 
these researchers frown on people trying to get help by using alternative methods rather than the 
conventional ones that don’t seem to help. Would they prefer that fibromyalgia sufferers just 
accept the fact that they have fibromyalgia, that nothing can help them and they should suffer 
silently for the duration? Do the authors consider bodywork therapies such as osteopathy, soft 
tissue and neuromuscular techniques alternative therapies, since these therapies are frequently 
used in the treatment of this most distressing condition?  
BENDELOW and WILLIAMS, Department of Applied Social Studies, University of Warwick, 
Coventry UK write that studies regarding the lay evaluation of pain-relief clinics are rare, 
particularly in the UK. The authors conducted a small-scale qualitative study which followed the 
vicissitudes of hope and despair of pain-relief attendees in London. The study demonstrates the 
complex interplay between peoples’ pain careers, their styles of adjustment, socio-demographic 
characteristics, and their evaluations of medical treatment. Unfortunately for many patients, this 
was the end of the road, their last hope of finding relief. However, the overriding feeling was of 
medicine having failed these people. The paper discusses these findings and includes discussion 
for possible future research.

SEERS, Royal College of Nursing Institute, Radclife Infirmary, Oxford UK reports the results of a 
study which investigated the experiences of 75 people with chronic non-malignant pain. The 
author writes that people with chronic non-malignant pain may find that traditional medical 
techniques do not alleviate their pain and may have to learn to live with the pain which can affect 
their lives in many ways. The study collected qualitative data illustrating what it meant to people 
to experience this chronic pain. It was shown that pain adversely affected many dimensions of 
sufferers’ lives, which effects extended to family and friends. Having others believe that the pain 
was real was crucial to many patients. Health care professionals can offer these patients a great 
deal to help them come to terms with the way in which pain has affected both themselves and 
others in their lives.

COMMENTS: I wholeheartedly recommend to any pain sufferer the excellent book Full 
Catastrophe Living: How to cope with stress, pain and illness using mindfulness meditation by 
Jon Kabat-Zinn (Piatkus Books, 1996 £14.99). This book details the successful strategy 
employed by the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center using 
mindfulness meditation. This book also has about the finest description of meditation and how to 
use it for pain relief that I have yet to read.  
GOOD, Case Western Reserve University, Frances Payne Bolton, School of Nursing, Cleveland 
Ohio USA writes that postoperative patients vary in their response to pain and opioid medication 
and that it is important that nurses can offer other options as adjuvants to medication. Relaxation 
and music may reduce pain by interrupting the postoperative cycle of pain, muscle tension and 
sympathetic activity. The author reviews (51 references), summarises and critiques studies on the 
effectiveness of relaxation and music used during postoperative pain. RESULTS: Relaxation and 
music were effective in reducing affective and observed pain in the majority studies, but were less 
often effective in reducing sensory pain or opioid intake. However, differences between surgical 
procedures, experimental techniques, activities during testing, measurement of pain and amount 
of practice make direct comparisons difficult. Also, the validity of the studies’ conclusions are 
further reduced because of problems of inadequate sample size, lack of random assignment, no 
 assurance of pretest equivalence, delayed post-test administration and no control for opiates at 
the time of testing. Nevertheless, randomised controlled studies of the types of relaxation and 
music most helpful to postoperative patients should be explored.

HENTSCHEL and colleagues, Klinik Blankenstein, Hattingen, Germany write that complementary 
medicine is used to varying extent in industrial nations. They write that there are incomplete data 
regarding the efficacy, safety and costs of such treatment, with little known regarding special 
features and motivation of individuals choosing complementary medicine. The authors conducted 
a study to ascertain any sociodemographic, disease-related, psychological and life-style 
differences between users of complementary and conventional medicine. METHODS: 419 
patients, recruited from specialist internal or general medical practices were divided into 2 groups: 
Group 1 – conventional medicine users: 91 women, 106 men, average age 43.2 years; Group 2 – 
complementary medicine users: 159 women, 63 men, average age 43.2 years. The results from 
the standardised interview and questionnaire with 168 items was statistically analysed. 
RESULTS: Compared to the conventional medicine group, patients treated with complementary 
medicine clearly differed with respect to sociodemographic, disease-related and psychological 
and life-style characteristics. The relationship between patient-doctor differed between the 
groups. Compared to the conventional group, those in the complementary group had a higher 
educational level and lower risk factors for smoking and alcohol use. Patients from both groups 
preferred conventional medicine for serious diseases, such as heart attack, tumour and AIDS. 
CONCLUSIONS: Patients choosing complementary medicine had a healthier life-style. As the 
efficacy risks and costs of complementary medicine have been inadequately investigated, 
research in this area should be intensified.

BOURGEAULT, York Centre for Health Studies, York University, North York, Ontario, Canada 
ivyh@yorku.ca studied the attitudes and reactions of physicians to their patients' use of 
alternative cancer therapies, factors affecting these reactions and physicians' views of how the 
use of these therapies affected the physician-patient relationship. METHODS: Participants were 
18 oncologists and 12 general practitioners (GPs) in Toronto. RESULTS: Many physicians were 
unfamiliar with alternative cancer therapies and indicated that their main information sources 
were their patients and the lay press. Although most of the physicians thought that the efficacy of 
alternative therapies was scientifically unproven, they respected their patients' decision to use 
them and encouraged them to continue with conventional treatment. Factors which influenced 
physicians' reactions included: the prognosis with standard treatment; exclusivity of the use of 
alternative therapies; and whether the alternative therapies were harmful. Although most 
physicians felt that the use of alternative cancer therapies did not affect the physician-patient 
relationship, several indicated that this caused some tension. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of 
information by physicians regarding alternative cancer therapies and their clinical efficacy, 
physicians' attitudes toward their use by patients are influenced more by the efficacy or inefficacy 
of conventional treatment and the invasiveness of the alternative therapy rather than by the 
efficacy of the alternative therapy used. Bourgeault IL. Physicians' attitudes toward patients' use 
of alternative cancer therapies. Can Med Assoc J 155(12): 1679-85. Dec 15 1996. 
PLASEK and ZVAROVA, Biofyzikalni oddeleni, Fyzikalni ustav UK pri MFF UK, Prague, Czech

(Lancet, 1986ii, pp 881-886 and 1994ii, pp 1601-1606), claiming that the effect of homoeopathy is 
significantly different from placebo. The authors also review biophysical hypotheses regarding the 
mechanism of action of homoeopathic remedies.

 WALACH and RIGHETTI, Abteilung Rehabilitationspsychologie, Universitat Freiburg, 
Bundesrepublik Deutschland Germany provide a review (91 references) of homoeopathy. The 
topics covered include: 1) the scientific foundations; 2) problems and importance of research; 3) 
basic and clinical research findings; 4) future strategies of evaluation. RESULTS and 
CONCLUSIONS: Homoeopathy is a medical discipline in its own right and is quite distinct from 
orthodox medicine regarding basic tenets, research paradigms and practical approach to therapy, 
even though both methods are empirically founded and share the goal of healing the sick. 
Difficulties are encountered when homoeopathy is pressed into a framework of research 
paradigm alien to its own approach. Despite these difficulties, some studies with rigorous design 
have demonstrated that homoeopathic remedies are effective. Important research findings are 
discussed and future evaluation strategies are proposed by the authors.

RANKIN-BOX discusses the potential for complementary therapies in Accident and Emergency 
(A&E) departments. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: While a number of therapies may be 
effective in emergency settings, nurses must consider the broader implications regarding their 
use in A&E departments. Complementary therapies will probably be used as therapeutic 
techniques rather than discrete therapeutic entities, due to the organisational context and the 
nature of acute work in A&E departments, an approach not dissimilar to the use of 
complementary therapies in other nursing specialities. While the use of complementary therapies 
as techniques may enhance therapeutic care and be beneficial in the short term, nurses need to 
reflect and reappraise what they are actually doing and the extent to which they can reconcile two 
apparently opposite paradigms of health care. There is considerable potential regarding the use 
of complementary therapy techniques in A&E departments; example of therapies and conditions 
are described.

MOSER and colleagues, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Vienna, 
Austria. GABRIELE.MOSER@WIEN.AC.AT. studied the use of unconventional therapies in 
inflammatory bowel diseases. METHODS: The sample population consisted of 105 patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 72 with Crohn's disease and 33 with ulcerative colitis, 
attending a university out-patient clinic. Patients using unconventional therapies were compared 
with those who did not in respect to: disease-related data, sociodemographic variables, patients' 
disease-related concerns and their perceived level of information regarding IBD. Concerns were 
measured with Rating Form of IBD Patient Concerns (RFIPC), activity of inflammatory disease 
was assessed by physicians using the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and the clinical 
activity index (CAI). RESULTS: Of the 97 patients (92.4%) who replied to all the questions, 33 
(34%) used unconventional therapies in addition to conventional therapy. There was no 
difference between the groups with respect to level of knowledge regarding IBD and 
sociodemographic data. There was a significant difference in that the longer the disease duration, 
the more often patients used unconventional therapies. The most important differences between 
users and nonusers were: patients using unconventional therapies were more concerned about 
surgery, being treated as different and feeling out of control. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a 
relationship between the use of unconventional therapies and certain disease-related concerns, 
which should be addressed in clinical practice and which may help patients avoid using unproven 
and expensive alternative therapies.

concerns: a study of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. J Psychosom Res 40(5): 503-9. 
May 1996. 
COMMENTS: It is indeed touching that these physicians are so concerned to save IBD patients 
money for alternative therapies. It is not surprising that the longer patients had IBD, the more they 
tried other therapies and that they were more concerned about the effects of surgery and their 
disease taking control of their lives.

BEGBIE and colleagues, Department of Clinical Oncology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, 
NSW, Australia assessed and compared the use of alternative versus conventional medicine by 
cancer patients in a public hospital oncology unit. METHODS: Out of 507 patients who attended 
the Royal North Shore Hospital and Port Macquarie Base Oncology Outpatient Clinic, 335 (66%) 
completed a questionnaire survey, of which 319 (62%) were adequate for analysis. The main 
outcome measures were expectations of and satisfaction with conventional and alternative 
treatment and patient characteristics associated with this use. RESULTS: Expectations and 
satisfaction with both conventional and alternative treatment were very high. Alternative 
treatments - dietary and psychological methods being the most common - were used by 21.9% of 
patients. The Median annual cost for alternative treatment was $530 and most patients reported 
"value for money". Young age and being married were positively associated, and satisfaction with 
conventional treatment was negatively associated with alternative medicine use. 40% of patients 
did not discuss alternative medicine with their physician. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion 
of cancer patients use one or more alternative therapies. The authors state that the use of 
alternative therapy may reflect on deficiencies in the current standard of care. 
Begbie SD et al. Patterns of alternative medicine use by cancer patients. Med J Aust 165(10): 
545-8. Nov 18 1996. 
COMMENTS: What a pity that the authors did not conclude that perhaps cancer patients use 
alternative therapies and are satisfied with the results because these therapies are helpful to 
them, rather than their more negative appraisal that people use these therapies because of 
deficiencies in current conventional treatment. 
ERNST, Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, University of 
Exeter, UK reviews (22 references) the risks posed by homoeopathy. The author writes that it is 
often assumed that homoeopathy, even though possibly ineffective, is free of risks. This notion is 
questioned in this review, where side-effects and complications associated with homoeopathic 
treatment have been published in the literature. The author further states that the question of 
whether the homoeopath is risk-free in all cases needs discussion. The attitude of certain 
homoeopaths towards immunisation is quoted as an example of particular concern. The author 
states that on the basis of these data the notion of totally risk-free homoeopathy is untenable.

ANDRITZKY, Institut Fur Medizinische Psychologie Der Heinrich Heine Universitat Dusseldorf, 
Germany investigated the spectrum of therapeutic techniques and methods used in clinics with 
psychotherapeutic or psychiatric activities, as well as the spectrum of therapists' qualifications. 
METHODS: Questionnaires were sent to 545 clinics and 314 responded. RESULTS: From the 
responding clinics, 127 different methods were named, with an average of 4 each. The larger the 
clinics, the worse the ratio of physicians and psychologists to patients became. In the clinics with 
less than 50 beds, there was 1 psychologist caring for 7 patients; with 51-300 beds, the number 
was one psychologist for 48 patients. the 6 most frequently used methods cited were: music 
therapy (36.9%); imagery (25.2%); dance therapy (23.2%); autogenic training (22.6%); body 
therapies (21.7%); and psychodrama (18.2%). In addition to physicians and psychologists, there 
were 38 other professional groups named. Considering the methods used by particular 
professional groups, an apparent trend towards a professional diversification was noted, eg only 
62% of music therapy was performed by music therapists, the remainder by other professional 
groups. Analysis of special remarks aresulted in 4 groups: discussions regarding the term 
alternative methods; recommendations to use unconventional methods following the clinical 
phase; conceptual changes of a clinic; and broader theoretical backgrounds integrating various 
methods, eg the psychoanalytic concept.

 Abstract 
 
Purpose/Objectives: To test the effects of foot reflexology on 
anxiety and pain in patients with breast and lung cancer.  
 
Design: Quasi-experimental, pre/post, crossover.  
 
Setting: A medical/oncology unit in a 314-bed hospital in the 
southeastern United States.  
 
Sample: Twenty-three inpatients with breast or lung cancer. The 
majority of the sample were female, Caucasian, and 65 years or 
older; had 12 or fewer years of education and an annual income of 
$20,000 or more; and were receiving regularly scheduled opioids 
and adjuvant medications on the control and intervention day.  
 
Methods: Procedures included an intervention condition (foot 
reflexology to both feet for 30 minutes total by a certified 
reflexologist) and a control condition for each patient (with at least a 
two-day break). No changes were made in patients' regular 
schedule or medications.  
 
Main Research Variables: Anxiety and pain.  
 
Findings: Following the foot reflexology intervention, patients with 
breast and lung cancer experienced a significant decrease in 
anxiety. One of three pain measures showed that patients with 
breast cancer experienced a significant decrease in pain.  
 Conclusions: The significant decrease in anxiety observed in this 
sample of patients with breast and lung cancer following foot 
reflexology suggests that this may be a self-care approach to 
decrease anxiety in this patient population.  
 
Implications for Nursing Practice: Professionals and lay people 
can be taught reflexology. Foot reflexology is an avenue for human 
touch, can be performed anywhere, requires no special equipment, 
is noninvasive, and does not interfere with patients' privacy.

 Key Points 
 
1. Foot reflexology is a form of foot massage that targets 
points on the foot believed to correspond to parts of the 
body.  
2. With an increased interest in complementary therapies, foot 
reflexology may appeal to oncology nurses because of the 
potential relaxation effects.  
3. Study findings indicate that foot reflexology has a possible 
positive effect on anxiety reduction. Effects on pain 
reduction are less clear.  
4. Nurses interested in using foot reflexology should undergo 
training and certification.  
 
 
 
 
Many patients living with cancer experience anxiety, and 75% of 
patients with advanced cancer experience pain (U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, 1994). Patients must manage their 
anxiety and pain as chronic problems.  
 
Patients with cancer often try alternative therapies (e.g., massage, 
reflexology, therapeutic touch, herbs, special diets) (Dossey, 
Keegan, Guzzetta, & Kolkmeier, 1995; Montbriand, 1994). However, 
patients often make these choices based on limited information 
about the efficacy of the therapies (Montbriand, 1995). Healthcare 
providers must conduct more research about these therapies if they 
are to help patients make wise choices about them (Montbriand, 
1993).

  Reflexology 
 
Reflexology is a form of foot massage designed to harmonize bodily 
functions and thus have a healing and relaxing effect (Tappan, 
1978). Reflexology is based on the premise that "there are reflex 
areas in the feet and hands that correspond to all of the glands, 
organs, and parts of the body" (Byers, 1983, p. 11). Reflexology has 
been used since ancient times to promote relaxation (Booth, 1994; 
Byers; Dobbs, 1985). In recent years, it has been used as an 
alternative or complementary therapy to relieve stress and tension, 
improve the blood supply, and promote homeostasis (Dossey et al., 
1995; Micozzi, 1996). Explanations for its effects are based on 
several theories. For example, the energy theory proposes that 
organs communicate via an electromagnetic field and reflexology 
assists energy to recirculate through blocked pathways. The lactic 
acid theory states that lactic acid is deposited as microcrystals in the 
feet and reflexology crushes the crystals and allows for the free flow 
of energy. The theory of proprioceptive nervous receptors states that 
a connection exists between the areas of the feet and the body 
organs and that reflexing the feet affects the organs. Foot 
reflexology produces its relaxing effect by relieving tension and 
stress related to physical problems. This relaxation affects the 
autonomic response, which, in turn, affects the endocrine, immune, 
and neuropeptide systems (Dossey et al.). Finally, the psychological 
explanation states that reflexology is simply a method of showing 
care and concern for patients (Dobbs). Reflexology's relaxing effect 
supported this study.  
 
No research has examined reflexology as a treatment for patients 
with cancer, although studies have tested the effects of other 
nonpharmacologic interventions (e.g., massage) on patients' anxiety 
and pain (Barbour, McGuire, & Kirchhoff, 1986; Crowther, 1991; 
Ferrell, Cohen, Rhiner, & Rozek, 1991; Ferrell-Torry & Glick, 1993; 
Meek, 1993; Weinrich & Weinrich, 1990; Wilkie, Lovejoy, Dodd, & 
Tesler, 1988). Patients with cancer cited massage as a method of 
nonpharmacologic pain control they used (Barbour et al.). While 
observing patients' pain-control behaviors, researchers noted the 
use of more pain-control behaviors than patients reported (Wilkie et 
al.), which supports inclusion of participant observation in research 
designs examining patients with cancer who are experiencing pain. 
A pilot study found that male patients with cancer experienced a 
significant decrease in pain after a 10-minute massage (Weinrich & 
Weinrich). Although pain was not significantly decreased one to two 
hours following massage, massage was advocated as a short-term 
nursing intervention. Ferrell-Torry and Glick found similar results 
after patients with cancer received a 30-minute massage. These 
nine men demonstrated a decrease in physiologic indicators and 
improved self-reports of their perception of pain and anxiety. Meek 
confirmed positive results after male and female patients enrolled in 
hospice received a three-minute back massage. The patients' 
decrease in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and increase in 
skin temperature were evidence of their increased relaxation.  
 
Ferrell et al. (1991) reported that patients with cancer experienced 
decreased pain specifically after foot massage, but no other
 research about reflexology and patients with cancer has been 
reported. However, reflexology treatments during an eight-week 
period in a randomized controlled study decreased premenstrual 
signs and symptoms (including anxiety) significantly more in an 
intervention group than in the placebo group (n = 35) (Oleson & 
Flocco, 1993). Omura (1994) used a procedure to map organ 
representation on the hands and feet of 10 subjects. Omura did not 
report statistical significance but claimed physiologic results based 
on an anatomic design. Reflexology has been used as an alternative 
or complementary therapy to relieve stress and tension, improve the 
blood supply, and promote homeostasis (Dossey et al., 1995; 
Micozzi, 1996). This article reports a study of the effects of 
reflexology on anxiety and pain in patients with cancer.

 Methods 
 
This study was a quasi-experimental, pre/post, crossover trial, with 
patients serving as their own control (Daly, Bourke, & McGilvray, 
1991). This design is appropriate when a treatment such as 
reflexology produces an immediate effect that may disappear after 
the treatment is removed. The patients were randomized to two 
groups: Group A (receiving reflexology on the first contact) and 
Group B (receiving reflexology on the second contact). The 
researcher used a coin toss to determine which patients were 
assigned to the control group first and which patients were assigned 
to the intervention group first. The researcher then alternated 
assignment of control and intervention for each of the patients, 
ensuring that every other patient was assigned to Group A or Group 
B. Anxiety and pain were measured prior to the intervention, at the 
beginning of the control time (a 30-minute time period during a day 
without the intervention), following the intervention, and at the end of 
the control time.  
 
Setting and Sample 
 
Patients were on an 18-bed medical/oncology unit in a large regional 
hospital in the southeastern United States. All patients with lung or 
breast cancer were included in the study during a 20-week period if 
they were 21 years or older, spoke English, and gave informed 
consent. Only patients with breast and lung cancer were chosen to 
limit the types of chronic cancer-related pain (somatic or visceral). 
Payne (1990) and Portenoy (1990) recommended limiting the types 
of pain. Because different cancers have different pain 
characteristics, limiting the types of pain makes the population more 
homogenous. A nurse researcher asked the patients with breast and 
lung cancer who met the criteria (determined through chart review) 
to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for anxiety (Herman, 
1990). If patients reported any anxiety on the VAS, they were asked 
to participate in the study. Patients with cancer who reported no 
anxiety on the VAS were excluded. Patients who had surgery within 
the past six weeks, open skin wounds on their feet, a foot tumor or 
foot metastasis, or radiation treatment to the feet also were excluded
 to separate patients experiencing chronic pain from those 
experiencing acute pain (City of Hope National Medical Center and 
Beckman Research Institute, 1993). Patients who received radiation 
to the site of pain were excluded. Patients with dementia or 
peripheral neuropathy also were excluded to ensure their responses 
were accurate (McDonald & Bruera, 1990). In addition, patients who 
had recent surgery were excluded to differentiate chronic cancer-
related pain from acute surgical pain (Coyle & Foley, 1987).  
 
The oncologists required a medical consultation before the 
researcher was allowed to seek participation in the study from 
patients exhibiting any possible symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. 
Reflexology is not contraindicated for patients with deep vein 
thrombosis, but the required medical consultation was physician 
preference. As in other studies (Booth, 1994; Byers, 1983), patients 
with lower limb circulatory problems (e.g., phlebitis, gallstones, 
kidney stones) did not receive foot reflexology to the areas of the 
foot associated with the diseased areas of the body but received 
foot reflexology to other areas of the foot. Avoiding reflexology to the 
affected areas of the foot that are associated with other problem 
areas of the body is a safety precaution to prevent, for example, 
stones or possible emboli from moving and causing complications.  
 
Most of the patients on the medical/oncology unit experienced 
chronic cancer-related pain for which pain medications were 
ordered. Twenty-four patients agreed to participate in the study; 
however, one patient died before the reflexology intervention, 
leaving a final sample of 23. Even though all of the patients 
experienced pain at some time during their hospitalization, they did 
not always experience it during the time of measurement for the 
study.  
 
Intervention 
 
The International Institute of Reflexology, which uses the Original 
Ingham Method, trained and certified the researcher as a 
reflexologist. Before patients were enrolled in the study, reflexology 
was described explicitly to them through a written protocol and a 
form that illustrated the areas that would be reflexed (i.e., areas on 
the foot related to a body part or organ that are stimulated by 
pressure of the reflexologist's thumb or forefinger).  
 
Foot reflexology was chosen because most of the patients were 
receiving IV fluids through the hands or arms, making hand 
reflexology less appropriate. Of the 30-minute reflexology session, 
15 minutes were spent reflexing the areas of the feet corresponding 
to areas of patients' self-reported pain and organs or body parts 
where cancer sites were located (to promote homeostasis) (Byers, 
1983; D. Byers, personal communication, November 1, 1996). If 
patients reported no pain, the reflex areas on the feet associated 
with the organs or body parts where the cancer was located were 
reflexed. The specific areas reflexed for breast cancer and lung 
cancer (i.e., the balls of the feet and on top of the feet over the balls) 
are identical. Byers defined helper areas as areas that, when 
reflexed, may have a direct effect on the afflicted areas and are
 used as reinforcements. These areas were reflexed to aid the 
specific area of the pain or cancer sites. Helper areas included the 
pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands to boost the immune response 
to stress (D. Byers, personal communication, November 1, 1996). If 
swelling was a problem, areas of the feet corresponding to the 
lymphatics were reflexed. The area corresponding to the solar 
plexus was reflexed on all patients as part of the relaxing 
techniques. Relaxing techniques, administered at the beginning and 
end of the session, comprised 10 minutes of the 30-minute 
reflexology session. Relaxing techniques consisted of a back-and-
forth movement of the reflexologist's palms on the outer edges of the 
patients' metatarsals and an ankle-loosening technique in which the 
reflexologist's palms were used to reflex the outer edges of the 
patients' ankles. Five minutes were devoted to reflexing the entire 
area of the feet to ensure that all areas of the body were covered.  
 
Thirty-minute foot reflexology sessions are recommended (Byers, 
1983; Oleson & Flocco, 1993; Rick, 1986; Tappan, 1978) and were 
administered using a crossover design during one of two 
consecutive researcher visits with each patient, between 7 am and 7 
pm. Half of the patients received reflexology first and then served as 
their own control. The other half of the patients served as their own 
control first and then received reflexology. Hospital-brand lotion was 
applied to the feet at the end of the session (lotion was withheld 
during the reflexology to prevent the reflexologist from slipping over 
an area). The reflexologist responded to the patients' comments or 
questions during the session.  
 
No intervention was used during the 30-minute control time. The 
researcher was not present during this time. At least 48 hours 
elapsed between the reflexology intervention and the control time. 
The mean time between the intervention and control was 2.4 days, 
with a maximum interval of 7 days. Patients continued their regular 
routine of rest and activity during that time period.  
 
Instruments 
 
Two instruments were used to measure anxiety and pain. The VAS, 
the simpler of the two instruments, was used to measure anxiety 
and administered first so that the procedure for completing a VAS 
could be explained. The VAS for anxiety is a 10-cm line with verbal 
anchors at each end stating "not anxious at all" to "the most anxious 
I have ever been" (Cline, Herman, Shaw, & Morton, 1992; McGuire, 
1988). The VAS score ranged from 0-100. The instrument has been 
standardized and is reliable (Cline et al.).  
 
The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) (Melzack, 
1987) was used to measure pain. It contains descriptor words 
representing the sensory dimension of the pain experience 
(throbbing, shooting, stabbing, sharp, cramping, gnawing, hot-
burning, aching, heavy, tender, and splitting). Four descriptors 
(tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel) depict the 
affective dimension. The words are ranked according to intensity 
from 0-3 (none, mild, moderate, severe) (Melzack). The Present 
Pain Intensity (PPI) component of the SF-MPQ and a VAS measure
 the pain intensity. The PPI scores range from 0-5 and are 
accompanied by descriptor words (no pain, mild, discomforting, 
distressing, horrible, and excruciating).  
 
The SF-MPQ takes only two to five minutes to administer and 
correlates highly with the sensory, affective, and total indices of the 
longer McGill Pain Questionnaire. It is sensitive to therapies such as 
analgesic drugs, epidural blocks, and transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (Melzack, 1987). Validity and reliability of the SF-
MPQ have been established with patients with chronic cancer pain 
(Dudgeon, Raubertas, & Rosenthal, 1993). Correlations between the 
long and short forms ranged from r = 0.81-0.97 for the descriptive 
words.  
 
Demographic data collected included age, gender, race, education, 
and income. Other pertinent information included diagnoses 
(specific type of cancer, metastasis sites, and diagnoses other than 
cancer) and, based on a previous study (Stephenson, 1990), 
medications (pain and other medications) taken within the last 24 
hours.  
 
Data Analysis 
 
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System and 
provided descriptive statistics, correlations, and univariate analysis. 
The Wilcoxon and Signed-Rank tests were used for analyses 
because of the highly skewed distribution of data.  
 
Group A and Group B each were pretested and post-tested at two 
separate times. Medications were treated as categorical variables. 
Demographic data were collapsed into two categories for each 
variable to enhance the clarity of the data.

 Results 
 
Of the total sample of 23 patients, 13 (56.5%) had breast cancer and 
10 (43.5%) had lung cancer (see Table 1). Of the 13 patients with 
breast cancer, 10 had metastases. Of the 10 patients with lung 
cancer, 5 had metastases.  
 
Medications given to the sample on control and intervention days 
were not significantly different. On the control and intervention days, 
14 patients (61%) received opioids. On the control day, six patients 
(26%) received nonopioid analgesics, and, on the intervention day, 
seven patients (30%) received nonopioid analgesics.  
 
Anxiety 
 
Anxiety scores, used to measure the effects of foot reflexology on 
anxiety, were significantly lower after foot reflexology in both groups 
of patients and between the two groups. Table 2 indicates post-test 
scores minus pretest scores with the reflexology intervention and the
 differences between anxiety scores of the control group and 
following reflexology treatments.  
 
Pain 
 
The 13 patients with breast cancer (11 reporting pain) experienced a 
significant decrease in pain following foot reflexology as measured 
by the descriptive words of the SF-MPQ (see Table 3). Because 
only two patients with lung cancer reported pain, results from this 
group of subjects could not be calculated. The differences in pain 
between the groups as measured by the PPI and VAS were not 
significant.

 Discussion 
 
Patients with breast and lung cancer experienced significantly 
decreased anxiety following reflexology. Patients with lung cancer 
experienced the greatest decrease in anxiety. Because the majority 
of these patients were male, gender was a confounder with cancer 
type.  
 
In addition, patients with breast cancer experienced significantly 
decreased pain, as measured by the descriptive words of the SF-
MPQ, following reflexology. Additional study is required to determine 
the effects of foot reflexology on pain as measured by the intensity 
sections of the SF-MPQ, the VAS, and the PPI. The fact that the 
mean pain score on the VAS was only 20.13 for the sample as a 
whole before reflexology and most patients with lung cancer 
reported no pain at the time of measurement may explain, in part, 
the nonsignificant decrease in pain in either group. Other patients 
were taking medications to manage their pain.  
 
The findings of this study are consistent with the literature regarding 
reflexology (Oleson & Flocco, 1993; Omura, 1994). Reflexology can 
be used to decrease anxiety and pain in patients with cancer. 
Despite the fact that the patients in this study were taking drugs to 
manage pain, 61% reported pain at some time during the study. 
Reflexology also can be an avenue for increasing human touch, 
which is a basic human need. Reflexology can be performed 
anywhere, requires no special equipment, is noninvasive, and does 
not interfere with patients' privacy. Some patients in this study were 
concerned that their feet might have an odor. Washing patients' feet 
first and applying cornstarch if the feet are moist can remedy this 
concern.  
 
Future research studies are needed to compare reflexology with 
other complementary/alternative therapies (e.g., massage, healing 
touch, relaxation response). Repetitive sessions of reflexology might 
be studied for a cumulative effect. Research on cost-effectiveness 
and gender and aging differences associated with reflexology would 
enhance the efficacy of practitioners' incorporation of reflexology into 
their practice. Research to ensure that the best nonpharmacologic
 methods are matched with different types of pain will contribute to 
the expanding knowledge of pain.  
 
Limitations of this study were the small sample size (considering that 
only two of the patients with lung cancer reported pain during the 
measurement) and the unusually high representation of males with 
lung cancer. The crossover design allowed the 23 patients to be 
their own control, which lessened the problem of a small sample 
size. Because only 11 patients with breast cancer measured pain 
that was reportable, future studies would benefit from a pain score 
minimum as part of the inclusion criteria. Replication with a larger 
sample of a single cancer type is necessary to limit the type of pain. 
Studies testing nonpharmacologic interventions for anxiety and pain 
continue to be a challenge but will provide vital information for 
healthcare providers to manage symptoms of patients with cancer.  
 
Nurses who wish to incorporate reflexology in their practice can 
study it in the book Better Health With Foot Reflexology (Byers, 
1983). Certification in reflexology through the International Institute 
of Reflexology involves 100 hours of study (books, study guides, 
videos, and seminars), 100 hours of documented practice of 
reflexology sessions, and a written and practical examination about 
the Ingham Method of Reflexology. Certification is the best way to 
ensure proper performance of the technique and can be obtained in 
a minimum of nine months. Practitioners can obtain more 
information about reflexology by contacting International Institute of 
Reflexology, 5650 1st Avenue North, St. Petersburg, FL 33710-7912
